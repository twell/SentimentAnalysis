Although Dr. Shoukri is polite, and did explain things..he would only tell patient the very basics, and leave important details out, which I found out later by getting a second opinion. He had the tendency to be condesending, and failed to write down changes in my medication, which caused problems with my pharmacy. Also, he was never on time. I felt like my physical well-being was of no concern to him. I would Not recommend this Dr.

I do like Wanner. She has always fixed whatever I came in for or either set me up with a referrel. My insurance as well as her office staff drive me nuts because while I know Dr. Wanner is flexible with writing me a referrel, getting that referrel out of the office staff is like pulling teeth. Expect to wait. I've never been taken on time. A normal wait time for me was 1hr - 1hr 1/2 although I have waited up to 2 hrs before being seen by the Dr. She has always taken her time with me and the one time she was rushed and I asked her to slow down for me she did. So, thats why I've kept going to her.

I would like anyone who is considering seeing Dr.Poliakin that you are making the BEST choice for yourself and your baby. I had 3 babies with another OB before I found Dr Poliakin!!It was night and day! He delivered my last 2 children and he is the BEST!!! If you have to wait in his office, it is because YOU are important to him and he takes his time with each of his patients. He never makes you feel rushed, no matter how busy he may be. Babies come at all hours so if he has a delivery to do then it is out of his hands! I knew that while I was pregnant my baby and I had the best possible care and I continue to have that trust in him today. Dr. Poliakin also has a WONDERFUL, LOVING and CARING staff! I agree with everyone who said they were sad after their babies were born because they missed the office. It truly is a great feeling to know you are in such TRUSTED hands.

Her entire practice and office is a mess.

Dr Johnson is an outstanding ob-gyn. He is knowledgeable, personable, listens well & answers questions. His bedside manner is very good & he cares about your well-being. He performed a complicated 3.5 hr TAH-BSO on me which included a week long hospital stay. I have had outstanding results because of his pre-op & post-op attention to detail and care. My only negative experience has been with long waiting room times for scheduled appointments. He's often called into surgery unexpectedly (emergency & assisting) which greatly increases the wait time for those of us with regular office appointments. Dr Johnson, however, is worth the wait. As long as he is in practice, Dr Johnson will be my ob-gyn.

I have been using these Dr.'s for my three children since the birth of my first son 8 yrs ago. The office is about 40 minutes from my home. Parking is horrible and for that I tried to use a Dr. closer to my home. I could not find a Dr. who I felt comfortable with the way I feel with Gabrielle Pediatrics. They are very caring and dedicated doctors. They treat each pt. as an individual and not as an insurance payment. Each and every doctor in that office is wonderful. Dr. Raptis is the funniest. I have and alway will highly recommend these doctors for anyone's child.

it's not that this dr. doesn't know what and how to do the surgeries, it's that he has too many patients...too many surgeries, too much money, so he gives only a little time per surgery...if less people went to him he'd really do a great job...unfortunately that won't happen , so his work is always poor...

Dr. Sasaki delivered my last child. I had a high risk pregnancy and she monitored me very closely, even calling me at home to check up on me at times. She is very easy to talk to and I felt 100% comfortable with her at all times. I even shared some personal crisis that had occurred in my life and she was totally there for me. I also had gained too much weight during my pregnancy and she only advised me about the risks involved but never made me feel embarrassed about it. I wish I could have had her for my Doctor for my first 2 pregnancies, she was wonderful and I can't say enough wonderful things about her knowledge, skill and personal care. I would highly recommend her to anyone who is looking for an OBGYN.

During my first appointment several months ago, something I will not forget is when Dr. Rosenblatt examined my mouth, she had bad breath. It is terrible for a dentist to have bad breath and breathe in your face when examining you. Another thing is the office was run down. The chairs in the waiting room were stained, and everything seemed so old- like out of the 70's. The examination room was also out-dated and seems like they don't keep up with modern practices of the dental field. After they scraped my teeth, I spat out into the sink near the examining chair. The sink actually had leftover spit and blood from a previous patient. On top of all of this, Dr. Rosenblatt is completely rude and abrupt. After my terrible experience at her office, I refused to go back. And now for the past three months I have been requesting my medical records and x-rays from her office. I called the office ten times and spoke with four staff persons, and have received nothing.

dr. kramer is one of the nicest guys. when i found out i was pregnant in september, i started at the practice. i choose dr. devlin for my doctor, but you are required to see the other two male doctors. i felt uncomfortable with this, but i had my appointment with him. he was extremely nice and made me feel very comfortable.
1.0
I felt like he had a lot of knowledge. Two concerns that I had, though, were: 1. Even though I scheduled my appointments first thing in the morning, so that he didn't have the opportunity to be running late because of other patients, he was usually not puntual. If I scheduled the appointment later in the morning, I'd generally wait at least an hour. 2. His office checked out my insurance prior to surgery and told me it was covered. Howver, I still ended up paying $11,000 out-of-pocket for the sinus surgery because he was out-of-network; he refused to negotiate on the price.

I would recommend Dr. Berger and CHTRC to any woman out there contemplating a tubal reversal. Not only do they provide quality service and hospitality but even years down the road after your TR, Dr. Berger and his staff are there to provide you with answers to your questions and support through the good times and the bad times.... FOR FREE!!! I've never found any Dr. willing to do that! And Dr. Berger even requests that a woman page him if need be.. How cool is that. Dr. Berger is a dedicated doctor, not only to his profession but to ALL of his patients. And the CHTRC staff is just as wonderful. From the time I called in to discuss having a TR done until now, his staff have been wonderful. Kudos all the way!!!

Extremely bright, current on new meds, research, etc. Practicing medicine is a labor of love for her. Very caring - takes time to really communicate with you and will recall this info. months later. Have never had a dr. spend this much time with me. When she was in a managed care setting, this would cause her to run late but now in her own private practice, the minimum appt. time is scheduled for 20 minutes and she is usually very prompt. I love to see her mind working as she does her clinical evaluation. She can without hesitation state how meds work, the chemical actions they cause in the body, the neurotransmitters that may be stimualated etc. The woman is SMART! She is also a very shrewd business woman, always trying to improve the efficiency of her office. I cannot believe anyone would have anything negative to say about her. She is the most knowledgeable, most caring, and has spent more time with me. Most important, clinically she is absolutely the GREATEST!

Extremely knowlegeable and very thorough; is in the process of helping me with a problem that no one else has been able to help me with; views my health holistically--is concerned with my general condition as well as the specific problem.

I have never seen or met such a rude, money hungry doctor as this idiot is. I had a serious medical issue and instead of seeing me right away, he told me I had to pay 155.00 out of pocket!

I cannot imagine choosing anyone else to deliver my baby, when I am positive that there is no one better. Not only is he a brilliant physician, but he is a warm caring person who goes above and neyond for his patients. I have never once felt rushed by him; he always takes the time to answer all of my questions to ensure that I feel comfortable and informed before I leave his office. My c-section with my first daughter could not have been better. He put me at ease, and it went off without a hitch. He visited often in the hospital, and always made me feel like his top priority. You won't find a better OB/GYN than Dr. Poliakin. DON'T LISTEN TO ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE!!!

I have just read the most recent comment, and am completely aghast....As far as I am concerned Dr. Golloub is by far the best physician I have ever dealt with. Not only am I am patient of Dr. Golloub's but I also work in the medical field and deal with many physicians on a daliy basis. Dr. Golloub rates with the best of them in both professionalism and expertise. It is a shame that a good reputation and fine practice, built on hard work, can be potentially destroyed by baseless accusations. It is very disheartening to know there are people that would try to do such a thing. Let's also remember that it is very easy to make such slanderous remarks when you can hide behind the anonymity of the internet.

He seems very excited about babies!

Dr. Feldman is a GREAT allergist. No, he's not the warmest doctor you'll ever meet, but he really does care underneath the sometimes gruff demeanor (he has called me to check up on me after appointments, etc.). AND, most importantly, he REALLY knows his stuff. He has been extremely helpful in keeping my allergies under control. Highly recommend him!

This man has great sales skills but extremely poor surgical skills, extremely poor! He was sloppy, careless and over aggressive with my surgery, and as you can see with many others listed here as well. It would not matter if he slowed down and took fewer patients he just simply lacks the knowledge and skills needed for some of the procedures he performs. The two I know personally are blepharoplasty and scar revision. His lack of skill, knowledge, compassion, kindness, will keep from the top. Stay as far away as you can. Also if you have had the misfortune of having work done by him please log on and get your voice heard.There messege boards on this site that are helpful.

ALL HE SAID WAS: I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO , MAYBE I'LL GIVE YOU A C. I'M ALREADY A FULL B CUP THICK SKIN. BARELY A C IS A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY ..HE HAD HIS GIRLS SPEAK TO ME ABOUT HIS WORK WHICH THEY COULDN'T ANSWER MOST OF MY Q&#63;'S ONLY A SURGEON WOULD KNOW THE ANSWER 2..OVERALL --SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAD HIM WARNED ME ..

i had a tummy tuck and a breast lift with dr. greenberg almost 4 years ago. I now have had 2 re-do surgeries, numerous lazer treatments, and very painful injections into my very bad scars. I feel deformed and i have really tried to be patient with the dr and see if he could fix these scars. But he seems upset and annoyed with me like im bothering him. I don't want to look like a victoria's secret model. I just want to look normal and not be in pain anymore. I've had other surgerys with other dr's and i have very little scaring. I was a good patient of Dr. G's but i feel he really has changed. It's all about quantity not quality!

I had my TR done in May 2004. I was scared out of my mind on what to expect when I got to Chapel Hill. Everyone there put my mind at ease and took care of us. The next morning I met with Dr. Berger before surgery and he was so kind and caring. Told me how the surgery would go and also told me there was NO guarantee that I would get pregnant. Well I am happy to report that I now have a 17 month old daughter. Thank you Dr. Berger and everyone at CHTRC for making our dreams come true! Dr. Berger is the best at what he does, he is known worldwide and I recommend him to everyone that wants a TR.

We spent 1000+ per cycle and were never even told if I had ovulated or anything.

If a physician does not take insurance, be very careful. She talks a good talk, but didn't really have much to say when I thought about it. Unless you are a text book variety patient and you don't have have a mind of your own, and you want to spend a lot of your own money I wouldn't bother. There are plenty of decent doctors around.

I had a tummy tuck, breast implants & lipo...he did not seem to take my concerns seriously...very poor communication...this gave very poor results...I was not able to get answers following my surgery to what my T.T. results would be. This caused more frustration and unhappiness on my part. I also walked out of surgery with a new 3 to 4 inch scar (appears to be a burn of some sort). His nurse claimed on the phone the following day that it could not possibly have happened during surgery...All I know is that I did not have it before my surgery and when I took off my bandages in my hotel room the following morning...it was there. I would not recommend him for a tummy tuck to anyone. I will say that he and his staff are very friendly and the facility is clean. The reason that I went to him was because I had friends that were very happy with their results...I was not happy with my results...the tummy tuck and the new scar.

My review is mixed. I have used her for several years out of loyalty, but I am seriously considering going to another doctor. There is usually a long wait in her office, sometimes unreasonable. She is knowledgeable and generally conservative in her treatment. I have gotten good referrals from her for me and my family. OTOH she can be down right rude and will lecture you if you question her or skip a few months on an appointment. She is also an alarmist. I was told that a HBA1C blood glucose of 7.2 was keeping my blood glucose in good control and another time I was told that 7.5 was terrible. Does not know how to work with people.

Both of my teenage children and myself have gotten braces here. My daughter and I are completed and have had them removed, while my son should have his off very soon. Dr. Belli and his office staff are the best in every possible way. Braces are not inexpensive, no matter where you go, and I don't really know how the costs here compare to other orthodontists, but I can easily say that he was worth every penny ...and I'm a real penny-pincher! In this age where complaints in the medical field are way too common, it's so very nice to know a doctor and an office like this! I would recommend him to anyone without hesitation.

My daughter has been using Gabriel Pediatrics from birth. Her PCP is Demetrios but at one point and time she has seen all of them and they all were and are very professional and caring. You always get a return call with concern and care and even and offer to bring in your child into the office so that you can make sure that all is well, (now that's care). I read some of the other comments and I honestly don't believe them because my daughter is 5yrs old and not one time in her 5 yrs of life and all of her wellness visits and tons of sick visit did I witness any of these behaviors. People should keep it honest. Gabriel Pediatrics by far is the best I even sent my teenage son there until he turned 20. I love them and to tell you how great they are I travel so that my daughter can receive the best quality care that she can receive. Hip, Hip Hurray to Gabriel Pediatrics!

I have been w/Doc Hillman for many years now & think she is a great person. She helped me thru my near death experience w/an eating disorder & she GENUINELY cares! She is very honest & upfront...i do NOT think she is horribly strict, she just really cares & has lost some ED patients (passed away) so i do not think anyone can blame her for caring like she does. She is non judgemental & she is a Doc who i've been able to be very open and honest with; without fear of ridicule or lecture. Lately, i think she has an incredible amount of patients & seems to be stretched very thin. (No pun intended!) She used to be able to spend ions with each patient, now she does her very best, but now seems more rushed, but none the less an EXCELLENT doc! She does not like using antibiotics, so i find it frustrating when im sick (i always end up needing them!) But she devotes her life to her patients & thier quality of life!

Well I have to say I am very unhappy with my breast augmentation. I was a 32a and I asked to be a 32 full c however my end result is a 32b. I am very unhappy with Dr. Corey on the fact that in order for me to have this fixed I have to pay another $2,500 on top of the $6,500 I have already paid. So on that aspect I am not happy because I paid to be a full c and to end up with a 32b is very upsetting and to be asked to pay more when he made a very poor judgement call I think is outrages!!

I am devestated. After waiting the 9 months to see her the first time, I felt confident with her professionalism and the time she took with me. However, ever since has been a nightmare. She cancelled our next appointment and rescheduled it for 14 months after the first visit. As a patient new to thyroid medication, I feel that it is medically unsound. Despite requesting my own bloodwork every six months on the meds, having them sent to her, following up and being told that the doctor reviewed them, I found out a year later that she has not looked at them. My bloodwork indicates that there is a problem with the efficacy of the treatment. I am happy for her that she is on maternity leave, but given her terrible track record, why would she not have someone take over for her. I feel neglected, abandoned, and at my wits' end. The irony is that I can't get to see another endocrinologist until after my next appointment with Freitag!

Really seems to be all about the $$$$. I had similar experience to those above. My first appt I didn't even meet with him, even though my appt was with him!!! Then I had to pay and go back to get my test results, and when I couldn't, the charged me to review my test results over the phone. They send you through a program, where you meet with about 8 different people, so that they can charge you each time. TOTAL CRAP!!! Stay away, very very far away.

Dr. Diduch has left his practice to teach at JMU but I still want to rate him in the hopes that one day he will return to family medicine. He is the best doctor I've ever been to. He sees you as a whole person and doesn't just try to fix whatever you're seeing him for. He recognizes the interconnectedness of the human body and strives to stay current on new developments in the world of medicine. He is EXTREMELY thorough and doesn't ever rush you. He makes you feel as though you are his only patient. He also really respects his patients and listens to what they have to say. Wonderful man and doctor - he will be sorely missed.

The worst OBGYN experience I ever had. Dr. Broadbent did not communicate with me during the exam. He did not tell me before doing a breast exam- we were just talking and then he reached his hand up my shirt! He also stuck his thumb in my anus without telling me. I have never had that done with a pap smear. I felt very uncomfortable during the appointment and made my husband come with me for my other pre-natal appointments. Also, the office cancelled three of my appointments without notifying me before hand. I understand one of them- he had to deliver a baby. The other two were because he decided to go on vacations!

After meeting with this doctor three hours after our scheduled appointment, we received generic advice similar to what we could have gotten off the internet in a 10 minute search. Also, Nye neglected to tell us some useful information we got after getting frustrated with her service and switching doctors. The last straw was when we had a late-night question and called her number, only to be treated rudely by her parnter on call. Having your first baby makes you nervous - couples deserve to be treated with respect and given helpful advice, neither of which we found here.

I strongly urge everyone to stay away from what I believe is this dangerous healthcare practitioner -- who is also extremely arrogant and holds himself above any authority -- including the Better Business Bureau and the IL Attorney General -- two organizations with which I filed complaints about his services -- particularly when he failed to address my reasonable concerns about them -- esp his FAILURE to properly address my health concerns. He actually gave advice that hurt me! His website and staff are trained to lure you in -- then it starts -- you pay $200 for this & that staffperson each month, $300 for supplements & other products -- oh -- available from his store! Try to hold this joker to accountability&#63; he AND his staff ignore you. Then, they demand $. I sic'd the IL A/G on him -- he repeatedly outrageously ignored her -- the AG even stated we find your health claims unsubstantiated. This whacko is arrogant & has got a racket going -- stay away if you value your health!

Would definitely not recommend this dentist. Tried to convince me to have unnecessary procedures, such as capping all my teeth and deep scale cleaning. I was 25 years old with very good teeth - had only had 2 cavities in my life and never even needed braces - and knew that deep scale cleaning was a pretty serious procedure. So, I went back to my old dentist to ask his opinion and he said I needed deep scale cleaning like he needed a hole in his head. Dr. Rosenblatt's staff was also unprofessional. I never went back after the inital visit.

I had used Dr. Hammon for five years while in Texas. I have lived in several different states and by far consider him the best dentist I have used. He is friendly and knowledgable. He also did not push me to get a bridge when he thought an implant was a better option (he did not do implants). He is somewhat of a perfectionist, which is a good trait in a dentist. He did not seem to be satisified until the crown molds were perfect. I had a hygenist in another state doing my intial screening (I was a new patient) and she made the comment, a very nice crown on... when charting my gums.

This guy is the absolute BEST in his field! He repaired both of my thumbs (basil joint arthritis). He also performed a laminectomy on my lower back. Each time with 100% results. He is a very kind christian family man, with a strong orthopedic practice. I have sent three other family members to Dr. Wood, each person with 100% results. He explains each and every step and has a wonderful bedside manner! The recovery/after care is just as perfect as the first visit! Thank you Dr. Wood :)

Dr Mona and Dr Mo are the best..17 yrs ago my daughter was in the hospital due to a birthdefect, I had different pediatrican at the time, but watching Dr. Mona come in and out and the way she cared for her patients, I immediately switched, with one quick observation she noticed everything I had concerns about and took charge immediately, 2 additional children, she is still my Dr of choice. I will see others in her practice, but when you need her she's there for you. I love Dr. Tantawi, she is the smartest woman I have ever meet, you almost feel guilty taking up her time. We are blessed to have her. On another note, I will say that her office staff could use some time management skills, cst service skills and be a little more polite, but the nurses are awesome.. it's worth the wait..

Dr. Larkin is very personable and caring. She has been my physician and my wife, daughter and son's doctor for over 6 years. She alwayscalls us personally with laboratory results, usually late into the evening long after her work day should have been over. She is very up to date with internal medicine knowledge, and also is attentive to hear any new information her patients may have learned from other sources. Her staff is caring and courteous. I will never find another doctor and I hope that she keeps me as her patient.

I will gladly wait for him, as our conversations are fruitful, thought provoking, and filled with good insight.

Recently wrote in on Dr. Konsker and wanted to make an additional note. I had a follow up visit and was once again very happy with his assistance. He is a very kind and knowledgeable doctor. He has a great disposition with his patients and does not make you feel like just another a number. He seems to genuinely care about his patients. I got in very quickly considering I was 10 minutes late. He is very punctual when it comes to your appointment time.

Dr. Barry is the type of doc that tells you treatment options and asks which you want to try, not the type that tells you what to do. She provides samples of meds when new or your prescription is low. When I first started seeing Dr. Barry, I wondered if she was listening to everything I said. She would let me talk, but didn't have much to say in response. I have since seen my medical records and see the meticulous notes she took on the things I said. I usually had to wait a long time for my appointment, often 30-50 minutes beyond the set time. I found her regular nurse to be horrible. She didn't convey correct info on symptoms to the doc, didn't bother to take vitals, and, when she made a mistake in getting my appt. in the books, refused to admit she made the mistake and blamed me. (wanted to tell the doc, but feared retribution, as you have to go through the nurse to get to the doc)

When I was pregnant with my daughter years ago, my doctor was in practice with Dr. Ellis. Then, they had it arranged where I would see my doctor one month and Dr. Ellis the next (there were only two there at the time). It was my first pregnancy and I was scared and had questions. Whenever I asked Dr. Ellis a question he would reply with a sarcastic remark like I was an idiot and should already know the answer. It got to where I would wait until I saw my doctor to ask questions or I would call the nurse and ask. I swore if I went into labor when Dr. Ellis was on duty I would cross my legs and pop before I would let him deliver me. Luckily, my doctor was there when I went into labor. Dr. Ellis had a patient in the bed next to me in the labor room. She was moaning and I heard him tell her It's not that bad. He's a real jerk in my opinion

I have read the other reviews and am happy that these individuals had such great experiences. Wish I could say the same. This doctor announced at the start of my yearly physical that he only had 10 minutes. I barely scratched the surface with my list of questions. As a result, some mistakes were made with tests and prescriptions which should have been avoided. I felt completely demoralized and realized that this Doctor cared very little about me as a patient. Perhaps the P.A. Foundation is moving towards more of a Kaiser model, rushing patients in and out, allowing no time to properly tend to the person's health issues.

I once again have to say Dr. Konsker is excellent! He is very punctual for getting in to see you and I was seen quickly. Called one day prior to my appointment and the staff got me in the next day. The staff is very nice. Dr. Konsker explained everything to me through my visit. I have to disagree with the other posts regarding his inappropriate comments and his abruptness. He was nothing of the sort in my visit and makes you feel comfortable in an uncomfortable situation/exam. He is very informative and definitely does not brush off your concerns in any way! His disposition is the best!! I highly recommend Dr. Konsker to all my friends. Olsen

Dr. Riss is very concerned about the patient and their quality of life.  He is very easy to talk to and never rushes an office visit.

The first time, within two minutes, she scheduled me for a colonoscopy and upon finding nothing with the test dismissed me with no information on how to handle IBS  I have since purchased a book that includes all the options for treating this acute condition along with other conditions that must be ruled out before making an IBS diagnosis.

Dr. Horah and her overweight husband (who works the front desk and looks like a beefed up version of Dr. Phil) are two of the most incompetent people I have ever dealt with before in my lifeDr. Horah has no idea what she's doing (95% of the time she'll refer you to a specialist) and her husband runs the most unorganized doc office in the state. Don't believe me - just ask them to send a referral over for you to a specialist. If you're lucky enough to get them on the phone (when they're not at lunch bw 11 and 2 or some worthless answer machine service rep answers the phone to take a message) they'll promise and promise they'll send your referral over but never do.

He seems really nice at first but don't fall for it like we did. I don't think he means any harm but he doesn't have common sense and our family suffered for it. Luckily four days after my son was born we switched doctors.

i checked out this site because i was curious about dr. grossier. i had my worst medical experience with him a few years ago. i had a simple wart that needed to be removed. i waited for 2 1/2 hours and then complained to his staff and him as i was finally led into an examination room. he apologized and said he would make sure upon my next visit to take me in a more timely manner. without warning he used a freezing agent to burn off the wart. he seemed to enjoy causing me pain. then he took the freezing agent and spilled it on the ground in a very antagonistic way. the liquid evaporated. i'll never forget the look on his face. he got me back for complaining. i believe he is not only rude, but sadistic. i would never recommend him to anybody. something's wrong with him!!!

Having had Dr. Shervin as my dentist for years, I have always been extremely pleased with his caring, wit, and great dentistry. Years ago the office could be a bit intimidating for non-Persian speakers, but these days the whole staff is friendly and helpful regardless of language. It should also be noted that the hygienist is EXCELLENT, and a very sweet woman.

Dr. Botnick is an interesting character. He is also a wonderful Orthodontist! He is quick and to the point. He does what needs to be done and that's it. He doesn't waste your time or his! My son's teeth were terribly crooked. He needed some teeth to be pulled to make room for straightening. Now My son's teeth look beautiful! He still has a few months to go. Barbie is an absolutely wonderful assistant. Very helpful and explains everything. My son & I recommend Dr. Botnick!

As a previous employee, and a Dental professional, Dr Barbat can be described as no less than an angel of her profession! Her work speaks for itself, and the care she provides for her patients cannot be put into words. Every ounce of work in my mouth has her name on it, and any time I visit a Dentist,they can't believe the perfection. It's really ashame to hear negative comments about her pricing because she runs demographics to compare pricing in her area,and trys to stay in the mid-range for fairness. I believe you get what you pay for, and lets face it, most people,with proper dental care,plan on having their teeth for a long time!!! Jennifer D. South Lyon,MI.

I had my TR almost 3 years ago. After having an HSG to find out if my tubes were open and being told they were indeed closed I mailed my films to Dr. Berger. He told me that my tubes were open. After contacting them with a question and no reply I have decided that they are only nice to those who actually have success in concieving a child. I am very saddened by they fact that my DH and I wasted so much money on something that they don't care worked or not. They treat you like queens while you are there but if you have trouble after that it is like you don't exist.....Very unhappy with the whole experience.

Dr K is a nice doctor. When I see/say him I feel a bit out of his league with what I have wrong, but he won't admitt it to me. He told me once after a workup that he couldn't find anything wrong with me, so there wasn't. I ended up having a debilitating neruo. condition. I know he may not have been able to diagnose it himself, but I wish he would have referred me to a neurologist-I luckily fumbled on one who sent me to another that finally helped me out. I do like Dr. Kotsonis, but he is basically general/sports medicine.

Horrible experience...Very similar to another complaint on the forum. I had a filling fall out as well. I went in and got a crown done. I had bad food pockets and needed to have the crown replaced a 2nd time. I then had to have my root taken out. I still have a problem with the crown and have decided to use a different dentist and I am out on the money that I spent. I tried to work with the office, but they were terribly rude and the dentists wife handles the money and wouldnt go for a refund. This dentist has caused me pain and major discomfort that has gone on for almost 9 months. I will have my new crown done in a couple of weeks and my new dentist told me that I have developed severe gingivitas in the area of the crown. This quy is a major quack and I cant believe that he would even want to risk his reputation by treating clients like this that have had terrible work done.

After a successful first pregnancy and with no medical check up or testing Dr. Moore stated that maybe I shouldn’t have any more children. I could not believe my ears!

Very personable, responds to your questions. Very proactive. My only complaint is with the receptionist. They replaced a friendly, caring receptionist, with one who is aloof, and is not friendly.

I am blessed to have found to Dr. P. He is very much no-nonsense and doesn't put up with BS.  He doesn't let demanding patients control how the office is run.  After I had my first baby, I had some problems with postpartum depression.  I went to Dr. P and I told him that something was not right.  Thanks to him, he helped bring me back into the light so I could enjoy my baby.  He still asks to this day everytime I go in there, how I am doing.  Yes, you wait awhile in the waiting room before you are called, but that's how it is.  People who complain about his punctuality, should just get over it since they are not the only patients he has. Not only that, but the best things in life comes to those who wait and Dr. Poliakin is the BEST!

If you want a good doctor who genuinely cares for the well being of your children, then Gabrielle Pediatrics is the way to go. Just bring a good book to help pass the time in the waiting room!

This guy is a TOTAL QUACK! I went to him for help because I have Sarcoidosis. They had me get a hair analysis, blood work (though I already had that done with all the results a month before) then they wanted me to get all their vitamins, etc. I ended up paying 1500.00. When I called for my hair analysis report, they said I had to make ANOTHER appointment to get my results! This guy has a real racket going on. Is a total goofball in my book. Also, the things he told me to take for my Sarcoidosis would have harmed me even more. He is VERY cocky, claims Christianity, but practices New Age techniques, he refuses to listen to his patient at all. God forbid if you question him. Now, unless of course you want to commit suicide and are too chicken to go through with it, go to Mercola, he'll help you out!

Dr Saway has been my doctor for about 18 years. He is truly one of a kind. He cares deeply about his patients and shows it. He is very competent, knowledgeable and up to date. I wish every doctor could be like him. He not only treats my RA, he treats the whole person. He listens, really listens, to everything I have to say and encourages me to tell him more. His diagnostic skills on a scale of 1-10 are off the top of the chart. He makes me feel as though he and I are a team working together to successfully treat my RA. I don't think I'd be here today if it were not for Dr. Saway.

I called Friday October 26th to make an appointment with the Dr. I said I would take her first opening. The receptionist immediately said January. She was very rude when I said are you sure&#63; I don't think she even looked. I only paid the 50.00 not the 300.00 or the 1000.00 maybe that's why I was told Jan 30. I wasn't even looking for a physical. I wanted an appointment to   get a blood test and talk about my thyroid medication. I did not take the appointment. I am going to call back and see if someone else answers the phone. That women on Friday could not have been more rude to me. If I get the same answer then I will know she is using a three tiered system. 50.00 patients, 300.00 patients, 1000.00 patients. If you pay fifty like I did you get the leftovers. I told my husband who is a physician and he laughed and said of course you are. I should have read that letter more carefully. Now if he called for me I would get in right away. We don't have the same name.

Significantly improved my quality of life; always willing to listen; very compassionate and extremely smart; follows up; did not give up on me until she resolved the medical issues, which were very debilitating. Has good relationships with a network of specialists, which is terribly important to those of us who have had major life threatening illnesses. Simply the best and I feel fortunate to be in her practice.

I am very happy with Dr. Hochstadt. She always listens to my concerns and always has a wealth of knowledge to share with me.

She also knew when to tell me, the overly concerned parent, when it was time to relax and stop worrying!

1st consult went very well. He suggested a 2nd appointment due to number of procedures. At our 2nd meeting he changed his surgical approach and was very curt. He was egotistical, rude and insulting refusing to answer my questions. He behaved as if I had no right to question him as he was the far superior being. I don't care how good a surgeon he is in the surgery room, I was given zero proper preparation on procedures and recovery process. Extremely disturbing experience.

Dr. Doherty will give you a ton of pain meds, and within a couple of months tell you that you are a drug addict and need to be admitted for a 72 hour evaluation to see if you are an actual addict! I was on 30mg of Methadone and within a couple of months, he had me up to 150mgs even though I told him I could handle what pain I had. It was one month after I was increased to 150mgs, he told me I was a drug addict!! Thank Gd for my other MDs who thought he was nuts for doing and saying what he did and have helped me with my pain issues. I have since moved to another Pain Management Dr (after having lost trust in any new MDs because of Dr. Doherty) who also questions Dr. Doherty and his practices. Further, after speaking to others that have been to Dr. Doherty, they too have had their pain meds increased even though they did not want them increased and Dr. Doherty also called them drug addicts. I know I am not one, but if that had been the case, Dr. Doherty would have been the reason for it.

I haven't yet had the opportunity to meet Dr. Berger, however, I will soon.

If you ever ask a question whether you want a TR had a Tr a week ago or 10 years ago, your question will get answered. Once you see how much care he puts into his work you will know you don't have to look any further! Atleast I know I won't.

Dr. Sarnoff is a very charming, pleasant, caring, and dedicated gentleman. However, he lacks current knowledege and misses basic critical obvious problems. After countless expensive tests, for instance, with no results, a different doctor I finally went to discovered that the simple medicine I was taking was causing all my breathing problems. He should have checked into my medicines more carefully before ordering all those tests. The medicine I was taking was slowing poisoning my system and Dr. Sarnoff never checked that out. Months later I am still fine after getting off the medicine.

Dr. Dworin saved my life. He has a very sharp eye and recognized a suspicious mole that looked like a freckle. It turned out to be malignant melanoma. He recommended me to a surgeon, that removed the tissue and I have been cancer free for five years. I see him Dr. Dworin twice a year for check-ups. My son also had a very unusual problem, Dr. Dworin found the best hair and scalp specialist in the area and got us an appointment with the doctor right away. The normal waitining time to see the specialist is about 6 months! He is always polite and kind. Although he does see so many patients, he doesn't always spend a lot of time with you. You do get a feeling of being a bit rushed. His office help can be a bit abrasive, however, I have known them to be compassionate and kind when you have a problem. I am willing to overlook some things in order to have one of the best Dermatologists in Illinois.

He likes to boast about how long he has been doing medicine and always thinks he knows what it is but usually doesn't until the third try. You have to stay on him to get things fixed or he will forget. Him and his secretary can be REALLY moody and he always makes you wait a while in the room. He tries to be your friend and tells you he hates the insurance company but that seems so fake.

Dr. Broadbent was the on-call dr. when my wife went into labor. He did not introduce himself, he did an episiotomy without asking, and told my wife she had two contractions to have the baby because he had a meeting to get to. The nurse had to keep him around since she felt my wife was about to deliver. My wife had complications after delivery and he wasn't communicating with the nursing staff (7 people in the room at one time) and the staff were stressed because he kept leaving the room and coming back in 10 minutes and then leaving again without telling the staff what was going on. That left me asking the staff and the staff saying I don't know. My wife later popped a couple of the episiotomy stitches and there wasn't much they could do about it. I guess the good thing is that he stopped the bleeding and my wife didn't die, but the entire thing sucked and he didn't interact well with us or the staff.

Never to if you don't have at least an afternoon to spend. The last time i went, i left after an hour and 15 minutes, as the nurse told me it would be at least another hour to hour and half. They didn't care. They seem used to people leaving or complaining. He was so quick when i saw him, i felt i wasn't examined at all. Tried another Dr there and the same thing happened. It seems like it is all money here, as when you finally get to see them, they are gone in a flash. BTW, had a facial treatment done by one of the specialists and waited while she chatted away in the hall with a nurse..had to call her back 3 times. When i said that i never spent 2 1/2 hours for a microderm, she said nothing. I will never go back...and i tell everyone i know about the waiting.

I was so disgusted with this doctor and his staff that I switched OB's my 24th week of pregnancy. I would wait for him for 2 hours, only to be rushed out the door by him when I finally was seen. His staff is rude. He has no bedside manner what so ever! This man needs a reality check.

Dr. Gold had me on months of broad spectrum antibiotics to treat a sinus infection which proceeded to completely wreck my stomach. He diagnosed this as reflux (his cause for every ailment) and prescribed Prevacid. When my stomach continued to get worse, he told me to take the Prevacid 2x a day. My health deteriorated over a 2-year period under his care to the point where I could not digest any food, my energy cratered, and I slogged through the day with brain fog barely able to work. After getting a proper diagnosis from another doctor, I learned that I did NOT have reflux; that my stomach flora was completely destroyed from the overuse of antibiotics and oral steroids, which resulted in inflammation throughout my intestinal tract. It has taken 3 years and $30,000 worth of care to start to reverse this condition. I later learned that most sinus infections can be treated with a salt water nasal wash and steam with eucalyptus.

Way too expensive. Felt like she didn't answer my questions fully because she felt I wouldn't understand the answers, which I took offense to.

I stopped seeing Dr Olsen in 2005. At first she was good, diagnosed my vitamin D deficiency which added to my muscle weakness (I also have MS) & prescribed supplements, but never pursued whether I have a malabsorption problem despite my asking about that. Did not follow up as agreed with my PCP about when my levels should be re-checked (this is important as she doesn't take Medicare or Medicaid so I paid out of pocket). I finally made another appointment but saw only her physician's assistant who had not been briefed on my history and was not qualified to develop a treatment plan for my other endocrine issues -- the reason for my visit. Then when my vitamin D levels came back sub-normal, I was informed by a form letter with checkboxes... as I refer to it, Congratulations! You have: [x] RICKETS. If you pay out of pocket, there is no discount (so you pay more than she expects from insurers) and even if you make a payment arrangement you can't be seen unless your current balance is $0.

Dr. K is a compassionate, caring doctor. When I had m/cd quints, he sat in the hospital with his arm around my husband crying. He can be abrupt and he won't offer you much information that he feels you don't need, but that's his manner. I was a patient of his, then left, then came back b/c in this area -- I couldn't find anyone better. Another poster commented on a too quick exam. Personally, that's one of the reasons I like him best -- no more discomfort than necessary. He is a bit abrupt in his dialogue, but this is south Florida and all doctors are inundated with patients, I have yet to meet a doctor of any specialty who isn't abrupt to some extent. He is NEVER inappropriate with his exams (contrary to another previous post) and is an exceptional surgeon. Ultimately, a good doctor is that because of his knowledge and capabilities in the field of medicine, not because he's a nice guy. Dr. K is an outstanding doctor AND a nice guy.

Dr. Muasher did a thorough analysis of our situation during consultation and presented us with options without pressuring us to make decisions.

I was seeing Dr. Kritzer for diabetes. I had 2 miscarriages and my OB/GYN told me to look into a pump. I mentioned it to him and he tried to talk me out of it. I pushed it and he finally agreed to perscribe it for me. I got pregnant a year later and had a healthy baby. After the baby, I had an appt w/him and he had to cancel because he was going to be out of town. I was then going to be out of town and lost track of time as to how long it had been since I had been there. It was about 8months. I received a letter from him and it said that if I didn't go in within the next 30 days he could no longer treat me. I called the office that day and got an appt the next day. I went there he asked me a couple of questions and then asked if I got the letter. I told him I had and he asked me if I found a new Dr. I asked him if that was what he wanted me to do and he responded, Yes, I think so. How unprofessional and his bedside manner is horible! I am happy I found a new Dr. who actually cares!

She is the only doctor I've had the misfortune to meet that hates answering any questions. When we were expecting our daughter we normally saw Cogliani and Ajaz who are caring professionals.The fifth month was when we met up with Choubey for the first time and it was such a bitter experience.My husband and I had jotted down questions to ask at the visit.The minute she saw the paper she turned uncomfortable ,rude and condescending. For simple questions like can we have a video cam at childbirth &#63; she said yes but at a distance..I don't want U breathing down my neck! We wanted to know about using suction and forceps ..when are they options ..etc and she says that will be something I decide..during the labor I will not come to you and ask for permission to do anything..that is entirely the doctor's business. Unfortunately I was stuck with her during labor and the nurse at the time did any explaining at all She didn't so much as say Hello,didn't talk a word in all the 5 hrs there !

A very nice man and very professional, not too many doctors have the bedside manner that he has... he should train some docs on just how to have bedside manner.

He explains things to you so that YOU understand, and never talks over you like so many of the other docs do. He answers your questions fully and really wants the best for you. He treats you as if he were treating a member of his own family.dont think you can ask for more than that.

I was pleasantly surprised that as soon as I got to the office there was only a 5 minute wait. I expected a longer wait because I didn't even have an appointment. He is truly the BEST!!!! I would highly recommend Dr. Konsker to everyone.

Just to clarify regarding the comment below, thyroid nodules on biopsy can be malignant, benign, indeterminate or non-diagnostic. It is not uncommon for a nodule to be indeterminate or non-diagnostic on a biopsy and it does not mean the biopsy was done improperly. Indeed our radiologists and pathologists are experts at these needle biopsies. Repeating the biopsy or thyroid removal are options. If a nodule is benign on biopsy but symptomatic or the patient wishes, follow-up or removal are also respective options. Removal is certainly an option for a 3-4 cm nodule. It is true that the pathologists keep the thyroid in a container when analyzing it, but the operation is done very meticulously and gently and I do between 200 and 300 thyroid and parathyroid operations every year and take great pride in taking care of all of my patients, I think reflected in the other comments below. I would be happy to clarify any of these issues via a call to the office. Sincerely, Dr. Alan Dackiw

One of the most arrogant doctors I've met. First of all, I had to wait for over an hour before I saw him. They will first make you wait in the waiting room for 30-40 minutes... then move you into an exam room where you wait for another 20 minutes or so. When Dr. Sobel finally arrives, if you are not there for cosmetic reasons (i.e. botox and $$$ expensive procedures), he'll barely acknowledge you and spend a whole 3 minutes in the room. Simply a bad experience...

Dr Barbat is a great person, but be careful of how much her office charges for routine procedures. Some of base prices can really tap your wallet faster than you can say Ow I do not question Dr. Barbats heart, but they really need to do something about the cost to the patients. It almost seemed as though the patients paid for her new state of the art facility. At least I know I probably paid for some of it...

Dr. Ennis is moving from this office. So, Dr. Edwards is in this office. It was the worst experience I have ever had at a doctors office. I felt unimportant and the nurse practioner Amy that I saw today was AWFUL. She was like a robot she had no bedside manner and she didn't even let me speak to the doctor she spoke to the dr. on my behalf. I went in to get my Adderall sript renewed and she stated after she stalled for 30 min. plus that Dr. Edwards didn't feel comfortable giving me the prescription and if I wanted to continue getting the medication On-line illeagly I could. First of all, I was going through a pharmacy that I had a doctor that had to approve me getting the medication after 2 days I recieved the prescription. So, I wasn't getting the medication illegally a Dr. in the United States approved the Meds. Dr. Ennis is moving to his own practice. To say the least I will continue to see him. I recomend not to see DR. EDWARDS. Especially, The nurse Practioner AMY!!

I went to Dr. Messer after being referred there by a dentist-friend b/c of my fear of pain associated with dentistry. I found her nice enough, but she always found something wrong so that I would have to make and appointment and have more work done. Finally, after one visit where she told me I had to have a filling replaced AND out of the blue told me I was going to have work done because I was getting TMJ (even though I had no pain, swelling, clicking of the jaw, etc. and had never brought anything like that up), I went to another dentist to have a second opinion. I did not need anything done. At the second opinion I went over my dental records, including my x-rays, with a dumbfounded new dentist. I went back to my dentist friend and told him everything and he has since stopped referring people to her. The lack of integrity and morality that I encountered at the Messer/Belous practice is disturbing and I cannot recommend you do anything but stay away from them.

I have been a patient of Dr. Kubalas' for over 7 years. There have been times when i felt that i needed more care than I thought I was recieving, only to find that she was right on the money. I have had several emergency health issues where she was 100% on top of the issue and gave over the top medical care. She is very intuitive and if the answer to an issue isnt readily apparent, she researches old and new to find cause/and cure. She does not over medicate and in no way a dr feelgood by handing out scripts for pain. (I have a few to where that was thier answer to everything) All in all i would recommend her (and do) highly, just be patient and plan your visit. She wants to give good care and sometimes that means others need more time than the schedulers thought. One day this may be you :)

After extensive research, I chose Dr. Berger to perform my Tubal Reversal. Dr. Berger and his staff were kind and genuine as well as skilled. I was made to feel at ease from the moment I set foot in his office. Dr. Berger took all the time necessary to talk with my husband and myself regarding the surgery, outcomes and possible risks. My surgery was at 7:30 a.m. and I was back and recovering, feeling well, by 10:30 a.m. My recovery time was minimal and his staff continued to check on me even after arriving at home. I am able to keep in contact with Dr. Berger and his staff 24/7 through his website and message board as well as communicate with other women to compare and for support. My TR was successful and I am happy to say that after only two cycles I became pregnant and am now 23 weeks along! I thank God every day for giving Dr. Berger the skill and caring to specialize in tubal reversal and for bringing me to him!

Scheduled a consult for breast augmentation. Due to the wealth of information on his website, I was so excited to meet him. I came in with a lot of knowledge and a lot of questions. I even took my boyfriend with me who had questions as well. Dr. Teitelbaum answered all of my questions abruptly and condescendingly. He took my list of questions and answered them one by one going down the list, not even waiting for me to ask them or finding out which ones concerned me most. This truly made me feel like I was just another case # to him. He is extremely egotistical, impatient, and does not make you feel comfortable or assured. He made me feel like I had very few options for my surgery. It was the biggest waste of $200. I don't care how good of a reputation he may have when it comes to his surgery - if the doctor does not make you feel comfortable, assured, or make you like him as a person - you do not want to give him your business. And I definitely left not wanting to see him again!

I had used Miracles maternity for all 3 of my pregnancies. I didnt have a problem with it till my 3rd in 2003. I was never informed until I went into premature labor that he had no hospital rights at any hospital. When I was in the hospital the nurses looked at me like I was nuts when I told them who my ob was. When I questioned him about it at the office he stated he had vertigo and let his hospital rights expire for our safty. I had some doctor that I had never met perform my c-sec and tubal ligation. I feel like I was misinformed and would have changed doctors to one that could have seen my pregnancy till the end.

They answer emails and calls usually the same day, as does Dr. Berger himself. The care and concern they show is genuine. Angie Herring, Turkey, NC

Dr. Goldman did my gastric bypass in 2002 and I think he did a wonderful job. He is a very caring person and goes out of his way to see that our needs are taken care of before and after our surgeries. I'm very thankful to Dr. Goldman and his staff. Susy

Absolutely HORRIBLE! Misdiagnosed my condition and when I called asking for help she wouldn't answer and said she would have to refer me to another doctor and she didn't know. Sorry that kind of answer and care is not acceptable to me. BUT maybe others wouldn't mind, you decide.

Dr. Fry has been around for a long time, he's put braces on my oldest and now my middle child and soon my youngest. Dr. Fry is the only one in the area that's why I go to him but his prices are high. The staff is not the friendliest but I'm not in there that long, I usually get an appt. right away and am out of there quick, so i live that.

I have been seeing Dr. Dworin for a few years and I think he is excellent. On the other hand, his staff is rude and unfortunately I think that has colored most of the opinions you see here. For example, I had a traffic problem earlier in the year and it caused me to miss my appointment; his staff made is very clear that I was a bad, bad patient. I considered changing practices, but decided I wouldn't let a couple of &lt;female dogs&gt; influence my choice of healthcare provider.

Did my TR in 2/02. I have not conceived but the surgery did cure my Post Tubal Ligation Syndrome and give me my quality of life back. I have contacted Dr. Berger several times since the surgery and he and/or his nurse have returned my calls the same day and offered their expertise and advice. The whole TR experience from start to finish was VERY professional and caring and I don't regret the surgery even though I haven't conceived.

I had him do lipo two years ago. He told me I would look great at the consult. I didn't see him again until the day of the surgery. I wasn't happy with the results and when I went to tell him he had no time for me and told me he thought I looked great. When I told him I want't to compare by before and after pictures he totally blew me off. He told me it would cost another 4,500. to do a tummy tuck to get the results I wanted. Why didn't he tell me that to begin with. I left his office crying and neither him or his staff paid me any mind. He doesn't even have the nerve to tell you himself what the procedure costs, he has one of his office women disscuse it with you. After everything HE DOSEN'T EVEN REMEMBER YOUR NAME!!!! One last thing... I asked him about a breast reduction and wether or not insurance would cover it and he told me no way and blew me off. 6 months later I found a wonderful Dr. who did a fantastic job... and insurance paid for the entire thing!@!!!!

A condition was found in July 2006; the doctor dismissed it as I needed to work out (I'm 140 pounds); in March 2007 the condition still exists and I now have a similar condition on the other side. When calling the office she dismissed my concers, didn't offer to see me and showed absolutely no concern for my well being. She told the receptionist to send me to a specialist...a specialist she had already sent me to in September of 2006...obviously she wasn't even reviewing my file while giving recommendations. I persisted that I was very frightened and was dismissed 4 times...I have now changed my PCP but do not want anyone to experience the same horrible situation I have experienced.

I went to see Dr. Sobel back in 2001. I had syringoma (tiny growths on my face). My first treatment went well. He came into the exam room with an intern. He never asked if it was ok. He was very thorough. Unfortunaly I figure out that my first visit was ATYPICAL. He was putting a show on for the intern. On my second visit he rushed in, did not look at me, zapped my bumps, asked if I needed anything else, I said I had a broken capillary, he used another laser/cauterizer to zap it, said That's it and rushed into the exam room next door. He had fit my appointment in between someone elses and was obviously in a rush. No ointment,no mirror,no instruction. My face were he zapped the capillary started bleeding. After 10 minutes a nurse came in, noticed the blood and dabbed it with ointment. She said it was normal and that it would be ok. Well, I have a burn scar now. Part of the risk I suppose but I expected this from someone with less experience. I also expected some professionalism.

You will not find a better doctor to help you or your loved one in the fight against cancer.

Although Dr. Konsker may be one of the brightest doctors around I've often thought that he makes inappropriate remarks in the form of compliments.

I first went to Dr. Ringdahl a couple months ago, and right of the bat I was impressed with how friendly and nice his whole office was to me.

As the previous readers noted Dr. Larkin is fantastic. She knows her medicine, she's knowledgeable, she's understanding and caring more than other physician I have ever seen. One thing I've noticed she does lack is her hiring skills. She has had alot of turn over in the office and this last girl she hired she most of got from The Cincinnati Health Department. She's loud, she's rude, and her medical knowledge isn't all that great. If anyone needs to read over the HIPPA laws this is one employee that should because she's to loud to be working in such a wonderful office. I believe, as well as others (but they won't speak out) she's a sore eye for the office.

I had my TR done in 2004.It was a positive experience. Dr. Berger and Staff have a mission, and they do it well.I love the fact that there is a message board where we are able to talk to others that have had experience with Dr Berger. I never did get lucky enough to get pregnant from my TR,I went through IVF and I have my miracle.I think the only negative thing I can say about the whole situation is that I dont think many women are good candidates for this surgery,whether it be their age or their tubal condition.I dont think there is enough info provided for those that fall in those groups. IVF has a cut off age of 44 with own eggs,yet reversals are still done on women over that age. THey are advised to get an FSH done,and that is all.Fact is most women should consult with a fertility specialist before they fork out money, time and emotion for this journey. It is an incredible one to go on, and I cant think of a better DR to go on it with. Just make sure you are prepared for the ride.

I do not plan to ever change doctors as I have not received the same level of service at other offices I have been seen at.

I am currently going through my first pregnancy and happily going through it with Dr. Konsker. I had a lot of gynelogical issues before getting pregnant that he handled with care. I couldnt be happier to have him as my doctor and my husband loves him too. His staff is absolutely amazing from Joy in the front to Pax and Joan, the nurses. They are like family to me and i've only been with them for a year. Dr. Konsker is so extremely thorough and doesnt take any chances...if you dont feel right or if you have a question, he has you come right in...the same day if he feels it's necessary. The nurses are happy to answer any questions when you call in. I thinks so much of all of them, I recommended my mother and several friends to see Dr. Konsker and they loved him too. He's very blunt and to the point but isnt that what you want in a doctor&#63; He has top notch equipment, clean and beautiful offices and is knowledgeable on anything i've asked him. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

The doctor is very knowledgable and gets right to the point. However, since the beginning, his bedside manner is not great.He isn't very reassuring to 1st time parents or any parent who need this when their kids are sick. He probably does not realize how he comes across to people. Maybe this website will help him to work on that. His dr skills are very good. He always gave me a correct diagnosis for my children. Dr Alvarado is not as thorough as he is.Front desk help needs to be more personable also. Very curt. New Dr Frank is very nice and knowledgable also. Bottom line, I'll stick with Dr D.

I was very disappointed with this doctor. The nurse asked me if I had anything I was concerned about, and I told her I had been very fatigued to which she replied well, maybe you're just tired!. When I talked to the doctor about what I felt like was depression, she immediately cut me off and said I would have to talk to a psychologist about it. I felt like confiding in a medical professional was the right thing to do, apparently not. I felt like this doctor was all business. Show you in, do your exam, show you out. Would not return or recommend.

Dr. Larkin has been my Dr. for over 10 years. After searching thru 10 Drs I finally found the best. She never rushes you, she reviews your meds and symtoms from top to bottom on every visit. She always on top of when new tests are due. She saved my life after I put off my colonostomy for a year and she finally insisted I have it done (something most people like to procrastinate on). It turned out to be early stage of colon cancer and it was caught in time and was completly cured. Not only did she save my life, but she has such compassion for each patient. She calls me at home when she could easily delegate things to a nurse. Bottom line is that she really cares... She's the best

Doctor Berger has made all our dreams come true. My TR was March 2007, I was pregnant April 2007. It only took one month to get Pregnant. The staf of CHTRC is Awsome. Everyone is friendly and helpfull. I love the books of pictures of TR babies on the tables in the waiting room it makes everything seem real for the first time. Dr. Berger takes time to talk to each person one on one untill all questions are anwsered and everyone feels comfortable. I loved the fact that a nurse comes to your hotel room the day after surgery just to make sure everything is good for the trip home. The surgery is so fast and almost no pain after.Doctor Berger found a hernia while doing my surgery and fixed it for me so when I did get pregnant I would not have any problems how great was that&#63; you dont find many if any doctors that go above and beyond like Dr. Berges does. I could have had my reversal in my home town but I wanted the BEST and that is just what I got. Thank you Dr. Berger and staff!

I've been a patient for 20+ years. In the old days, he would see you personally but now he has his nurse see you. Despite this, when you are treated by Dr. Shafran, you will be receiving the best care possible. He has a gentle disposition which is very comforting. I typically change Drs. often due to lack of bedside manner or incompetance. For me to have 1 doctor for more than 2 decades speaks volumes!!

EXCELLENT, well qualified and experienced physician. The most caring man I've experienced, who takes the time to make sure that you are well cared for. The reason the waiting room is back-logged is because he is just so thorough and refuses to compromise time for the quality of his patient's care.

Very friendly, very interested in the details of my post tubal ligation symptoms as well as my desire for another baby. Gave me the possible reasons why PTLS exists, interested in my outcome.

The post surgery period was almost pain-free, I only needed a small amount of pain medication for the first few days.

I thought he would be great, always on raido etc. Had to go back twice for breast augementation. First time came out un even. Went back 8 months later for surgery #2 to even them out and to go a cup bigger, charged me more money for his correction on top of trying to collect from insurance company. Two months later still lopsided and smaller then surgery #1. He made me feel like crap when he suppose to make me feel better. Rushed thru every appointment I had and wanted nothing but him money. No compassion at all unless you're green! Don't listen to the radio and do you research!!! I learned my lesson, looking for another surgeon to fix his errors.

Dr. Pass has a passive attitude and isn't sensitive to patient needs. I was suffering from horrible acne that started when I was 23 (of all ages!). I was 28 by the time I saw Dr. Pass.

When she commented to me It's really not that bad., I knew it was time to move on!

I used to see Dr. Su when Dr. Boorstein worked with her and he wasn't in. She might seem knowledgeable but i wouldn't trust her with any meds. She has told me to take meds incorrectly or given me or my friend (who also saw her) the wrong meds or dosages. When Dr. B left the office and moved again she wouldn't let him take his patient files with him (even though we had been with him since before he was sharing a space with her), every patient had to call up Dr. Su's office and have them sent over one by one to Dr. B. Isn't an out of the box thinker, nor did she go out of her way. If you wanted a special medicine you were used to, good luck with that. I'm glad I've moved and have the most wonderful MD now. And waiting an hour in a room with sick people is not ok. She's the only GP i've ever waited that long with. And If you needed to urinate in a cup, you had to walk through the waiting room to use the bathroom and then walk back through the room with the cup. She's not worth the wait.

Going against the majority of what's being said here, I have to say that my experiences with Dr. Gianfagna was most unfortunate. Many years ago as a child I suffered severe stomach pains (and to this day I still do). I'd been to see him several times until one day when I was with my mother in the office, he entered the room, in pain from the same condition, to which he pointed at me and said in front of everyone and Dr. George She's faking it. I was 7 years old at the time. At twenty-four years old now, I was finally diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, a genetic disease that triggers chronic pain of the pancreas and thereby prevents me from eating food of any kind until it ceases. Though it is incurable, I am comforted now that I am aware of this condition, and that it was not all in my head, as he very cruelly put it.

I had a hair transplant done about 2 years ago. Very unhappy. MD told me I would only have to have 1 procedure done and that it would look wonderful. Waited 6 months minimal hair growth, he told me to come back in a year so I did. MD was extremely rude yelling at his staff and carrying on that he was in the middle of lunch not knowing that I could hear everything from the room I was in. Told me it looks great and that if I wanted him to fix it, it would be another 5,000. Told me the problem is that people like me (what ever that was suppose to mean.) come into his office with high expecatations. I now have less hair than when I first went for the intial consultation. I am extremely frustrated and embarrased with the results. I would not recommend this doctor at all. He is very arrogant to top it off. Everytime I hear his show on 105.3, I turn the radio off.

My friend also used him and when she also unfortunately miscarried he was just as uncaring and unsympathetic. i would advise women that if they have any feelings whatsoever that using Dr.Patton will break there spirit i felt degraded when i left there .

This guy is a moron. He wasted three years of my life and caused my business to fold with his completely inaccurate diagnosis. He falsely diagnosed me with Parkinson's, which caused me to lose certain benefits. Unfortunately, once that's on your record, the insurance companies will not disregard it even if it's false. Due to his incompetence, my symptoms got progressively worse until I was pretty much incapacitated. Additionally, in his arrogance, he put me on several medications which I NEVER should have been on. I finally found a doctor who was much more knowledgable without all the arrogance and was able to properly diagnose me and put me on the road to recovery. I never had, nor do I have, any form of Parkinson's. Unfortunately, I will never get those years back and my business was irreversibly damaged. He shouldn't be allowed to practice on an insect, let alone people.

I think she is very busy, and if you have an ailment that makes you feel very sick urgently and seems contagious you are told there are no openings. But if you have an ailment that is not contagious (not like flu symptoms for instance), it's possible to be seen the same day based on some sort of triage. Expect to wait 2 and 1/2 hours and be seen for a total of 2-5 minutes. Expect to not have all your questions answered, be prepared to shoot them off quickly or the 60 seconds you have to open your mouth will be up. She will say she will be right back - don't be fooled -she won't be so you can't just think I'll ask her when she comes back. However she does seem knowledgeable, just very very busy.

In response the the previous comment I am a very patient person. I had an appointment on 10/16 Monday, I waited in excess of ninety minutes. When I did finally see the Dr. she was very rushed. I do not expect to wait and be the patient who is rushed so she can make up her time. I understand emergencies occur and doctors run late. I should not be penalized and be the patient who is seen after the long wait and be rushed. When she starts tapping her pen, and interrupting you, after seven minutes you feel rushed. I had previously received a call and had to be rescheduled since she is now working fewer days. I originally had this time arranged in August and was pushed off to October. I scored her low in the helpful category because of my experience that day.

I was initially ignored for 25 minutes.10 minutes AFTER I was already supposed to have been IN the appointment the paperwork was given to me.I filled it out and stipulated that I lost my CIGNA card, so I wrote all of the information on the forms.She said they don't like when anyone doesn't have their card.Then, I sat there, ignored, for another 10 minutes.The office manager YELLED out YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR CARD&#63; WELL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHECK THIS ONLINE!!! I said, Okay, you will see that I am covered. They then acted as if they couldn't find my information online and said it wasn't there.She then YELLED at the receptionist.This should have been taken care of earlier!HAVE HER GET IT FAXED FAST!WE'LL HAVE NO LUNCH AT ALL AT THIS RATE! Summary: #1.They wasted my time, not vice versa.  #2. They could have simply called CIGNA.       #3. I could have used cash. They didn't even bother to ask. I finally got tired of their rudeness.I told them they were ridiculous and left.

Our appointment was 1:30((they penalize your you if you (the patient) is late more than 10 minutes past your appt. time by making you reschedule (see display sign at office)). The Doctor didn't see US until nearly 3:00. Didn't mention anything about it even thought we were obviously concerned after asking her staff asking why we had to wait. My wife had strep throat with fever, chills and body aches and had to wait in the cold wait room covered with my coat 1 hour, then in the exam room 15 minutes. Who knows how many other patients (there were 5 others in the waiting area) could have caught this extremely contagious disease while they and we waited. After the nurse (not gently mind you) stuck her with the throat stick my wife began to cry. Otherwise the doctor was very pleasant and spoke to my wife as if she was a child, (child like) that is. Not a bad bedside manner if she were a pediatrician. She made no introduction, (even a hello) and spoke directly to my wife

If I wasn't having an exam, she wouldn't even sit down to talk to me. Also, she was NOT very knowledgeable to some very important things I had 3 other doctors pick up on.

Dr. Khan is an absolute jerk. I went to see him and I realized all the comments are convincing. Yep, plays favorites. And keeps muttering. The people at the reception desk are very insensitive.

I had a hip replacement with Dr. Fletcher almost a year ago. I am still walking with a cane and might have to forever because of the muscle and nerve damage from the operation. All he does is minimally invasive surgery. He said it was the best procedure and yet it didn't work out very well for me. I can't put weight on the leg or lift it into the car without assistance. I would not recommend him to anybody.

Wouldn't stand up to workers comp insurance and fight for my rights. Became impatient because I wasn't healing like he thought I should. Eventually gave up on trying to get rid of my pain, threw some pain pills at me and told me there was nothing more he could do for me. He was beligerant towards me because he was ordered by the comp insurance to be deposed (deposition). Demanded that my lawyer get him out of it. Before he was ordered by the court to be my workers comp dr i felt he was a good dr altho he did seem to like to send me to specialist for things like sinus allergies and various other pains I have. Almost all drs I have had always treated me themselves only sending me out if they couldn't get it taken care of satisfactly. He also always seems like he was in a hurry, barely spending any time with me. I would wait in the lobby usually 30 min after my scheduled time to be there, then be taken back to the little room to have to wait another 30 min. I have now switched dr.

I went to Dr. Chaudhry in the early 1990's and ended up paying a lot of money for not needed treatment. He kept wanting me to do things and I felt very uncomfortable. He serves a lot of the people in our local ethnic community and that is why I went to him. I did not realize at first that all he was looking to do was to make money off of me. Big mistake! Others have also said the same about him in the community and I had to discover this all by myself...:(

I did not have any good experiences with Dr. Kramer. I had a high risk pregnancy and felt that it was not treated the way it should have been. I was in and out of the hospital for the last five weeks of my pregnancy. He talked down to me when he would come to see me in my hospital room. Thank goodness another WONDERFUL Dr. was on call when I actually delivered. He never came to see my newborn in the NICU. I have since switched Dr.'s and would NEVER recommend this practice.

If you have baby with him you will be induced, you will be forced to have a c-section if it is not in his schedule and he will make up lies to convince you. If actually make it to having a vaginal birth you will get an episiotomy from hole to hole and he'll make comments about your vagina.

The most terrible doctor ever. Doesn't bother to answer any questions and brushes them off by telling patients not to worry. Told me that all my results were in and wer fine, only fo rme to find out later that some important test results weren't actually back, and actually ended up with problems. So he told me everything was fine, when the test results weren't even there. Very prodding into patients' personal life. No follow up. And very unprofessional conduct. Acts like he doesn't care about his patients, and constantly changes his mind - fisrt he told me results were fine, then something is wrong, then its ok again. Dont trust him, and get a secord opinion. There is no order to his office and conduct. With patients in 3 offices - no wonder. Hope this asves some women alot of heartache and pain!!!

DO NOT USE DR. JONATHAN COHEN! the worst experience i ever had with a doctor. Dr. cohen seemed uninterested in my health and helping with my condition. Ignored the severity of my colits. I went to his office for a scheduled checkup. I was in the worst state at this time. Had dropped 40 pounds. Couldn't eat. Totally dehydrated. Hands were cramping due to lack of electrolytes. Bleeding every time I went to the deficate, which was about 15-20 times per day. All this and doctor cohen did nothing for me. Let me leave his office. My parents who are not doctors took one look at me and knew I needed immediate medical attention. They took me to the ER and I was immediatley admitted. Put on an iv. Get the picture!

Policy when I saw this doctor: Women should be aware that this doctor makes you sign a waiver before he will treat you so that you cannot bring legal action against him for any reason (although you did have 3 days within signing to break this agreement). I found this odd at first. During the vaginal examination, this doctor made inappropriate comments (after inserting a finger into my pelvis, he said, Aah, I think I just saw a gleam in your eye!) and conducted a rectal exam without my permission and without warning. The nurse present in the room looked uncomfortable. After I got dressed, the doctor called me into his private room for I don't know what reason. I felt numb as I sat there as he asked me non-medical related questions. I felt violated and broke down in tears as soon as I arrived home. I was in shock and did not go back and break the no-leagal-action contract before the deadline. I wish I would have been emotionally ready to go back to that office and

Our family used him as GP for several years and we noticed he was quick to Rx meds and never really took time to get to the bottom of things. His lack of thyroid disease caused me great harm and two years later I am still trying to recover. He does not order proper blood tests and twice changed medication dosages without lab results. He is a rather relaxed personality but is also very stubborn and not really open to discussions once he has decided upon the problem.

I saw Dr. Polcer for Anesthestia/Pain Management and I found him to be very helpful. I have a disorder known as RSD that he treated me for with sympathetic nerve blocks and epidurals and I trusted him 100%. He performed these procedures in Atlanticare Surgery Center which I found to be pleasant except I don't think many of the nurses are educated enough and I also think the nurses need to concentrate more on patient care. I was very nervous about my procedure the first time and they weren't even patient with me, in fact they were downright rude. But other than that I would go back to both the doc or the surgery center if I needed additional treatments. The biggest problem with this Rothman office is there are many docs and the wait is typically very long. My advice&#63; Make the earliest appointment they have if you don't like to wait.

Terrible experience...I had a filling fall out. I went in and was advised that I should get a crown instead of a new filling. That was a big mistake! They pulled the tooth and put in a temporary for 2 weeks and it was terrible. The 1st crown then went in and a couple days later I noticed that I had huge food pockets. So I had to go back and have the tooth ripped from my mouth and a new temporary was put in. This time, I suffered from headaches over the next 2 weeks while waiting for my new crown to be made. I had that crown put in and and was lucky enough to have the same problem. However, a worse problem began occuring as I was now sensative to eating. I had to go and have a root canal on the tooth because it had now been damaged too much with all of the crap. I go back again and complain that the 2nd crown has food pockets and I am told that I need to replace the filling on the tooth next to my crown. I have ran out of space to continue, but trust me when I say, dont go here!!!!!!!!

This was the worst experience I have ever had with any medical professional. This dentist was very unapproachable, rushed, rude, and arrogant. She would not even consult with me when she ordered two root canals, three pediatric crowns and a molar extraction for my 6-yr old son. I tried to speak with her about alternatives, but she turned her back on me and answered with one-liners that told me absolutely nothing. She left the entire burden of explaining the results of her 'diagnosis' to her hygienist. The hygienist was left to do all the 'dirty work' that the dentist was too rushed to do. Of course, every time I asked a question she didn't know, we had to try to flag down Dr. Rosenblatt again and again, and she would then give only one line responses that were most unhelpful. By the time we had left her office, my son and I were in a great state of agitation. This was certainly a very unpleasant and stressful experience. And now she refuses to release my son's dental records.

My baby was breeched and Dr. Broadbent is a very skillful surgeon. All the nurses were impressed with how clean my C-section looked. However, I was not impressed with his personal skills. He was not concerned with answering my pregnancy questions and did not discuss treatment options with me. Even before we knew my baby was breeched he was trying to get me to schedule an induction date for his convenience. Dr. Broadbent did not give me a number I could reach him in an emergency and there was not always an on-call number for a different doctor. Addittionally, when I went into labor before my scheduled C-section, he showed up at the hospital and was rude to me as well as to the other staff at the hospital. When I had an allergic reaction to my pain medication after the surgery, I could not get in touch with him to change my prescription for 5 days. Also, his staff were friendly, but they all spoke English as a 2nd language and had difficulty understanding me.

This is a personal experience. He is a young doc and he has a good manner. I feel that he is following procedures completely without using judgement on special cases. He is especially tight on prescribing antibiotics although I have requested. Having severe sore throat more than a week with previous visit to urgent care and this young doc requires patient to run back and forth to visit him. This case is a little complicated because he was not the first doc to see me but I can tell the younger doctors follow procedures to strictly and they do not want to take any risk. On patient's side, I feel that if a doctor should find a way to relieve the suffering of a patient asap then to consider side effect of medicine. Besides, prescribing antibiotics in this case would not have so bad of the side effect to the patient, because they won't kill the patient if the patient follows instruction not to overdose.

Dr. Poliakin is a very arrogant physician. He is very condescending and speaks down to his patients. I would not recommend him even though he has a positive reputation. He does not take feedback well, becoming defensive and unprofessional. After presenting him with some suggestions, he actually had the nerve to fold up my wife's chart, hand it to her and ask her to leave the office and seek medical attention elsewhere. She was 37 weeks pregnant at the time. His actions caused us a great deal of stress, leaving us wondering if we were going to have a doctor to deliver our baby. I called him to question him on what happened during the appointment. He was very nonchalant about the situation and even asked ME to apologize to my wife for the misunderstanding. He never once offered to apologize to her directly. His demeanor changed dramatically when I contacted him regarding the situation. He even admitted his wrongdoing by admitting that he contacted his peers to seek their advice.

I agree with the previous comment. At first, he will seem like a nice person but once you are his patient, he will treat you indifferently. If you are rich, you will get the respect. Everyone else are nothing. There are lots of otehr doctors, a lot better than him.

This doc did a gastric bypass on my sister. He released her from the hospital with a 101.0 temp and a raging headache. She got home and started losing weight because she could hold nothing on her stomach. She repeatedly went back to Dr. Miles about the headache and he repeatedly blew her off. 3 months passed and she finally reached the point where my mom made her go to the er. Thank God for the ER DOC. when he found out she had had a gastric bypass, the first thing he did was order an upper GI. Guess what, there was a leak in her stomach and she had by now developed peritonitis. They admitted her and it took 2 surgeons to open her up and clean out what they could of the infection. She was in intensive care for weeks and even when she went home, she could have nothing on her stomach for 4 months. She was tube fed. AND THIS MAN WAS STILL ARROGANT. My sister had no, absolutely no other health problems. It has taken her years to get over this. PLEASE DONT USE THIS MAN!!!

Dr. Grabelle is a very nice man, but I needed a good physician. He diagnosed me with the wrong thing, and when the symptoms persisted I called for the test results and found out that since the office does not log the samples they send out for testing they didn't realize no results had come back before I called. I had to go again for another test, and am still suffering with the same complaint months later. I'm going elsewhere.

Only reason I kept seeing him for years since Dr. Kowalsky retired is that I could get in & out of his office on my lunch hr. with time to spare. Today was my last visit. Waited over half an hour in a flimsy paper gown while he chatted with his wife. Then another 10 min. while he chatted with someone else.  THEN he took a patient that was there after me. No soap in bathroom. Staff rude, loud and unprofessional. If you're part of their social club, they treat you great. Otherwise, not so much.  I put my clothes back on and walked out.  If they try to send me a bill, they'll not be liking me much!  Dr. Kowalsky was wonderful and I think he'd be livid if he knew what Dr. Konsker did to his practice.

The worst doctor ever. I had an infection that she misdiagnosed so I suffered for 3 months, even after calling and going back several times! She treated me like an idiot.

Dr. Nitkin is not certified in prenatal care! He never gave me any prenatal tests, he told me I didn't need prenatal pill, I didn't need to drink milk and even though I thought I had low iron, he just gave me some sample iron pills without checking to make sure I really needed them. I'm so happy I was smart enough to change doctor's when I did. My baby would have been born malnurished!! He is the worst doctor ever!! He probably doesn't have a degree anyway.

Not worth the trip. The atmosphere in the office was very uncomfortable and unfriendly. While the doctor came highly reccomended I found her to be highly disappointing.

Dr. Brown always seems to defer actually seeing patients to his PAC Kyle Bachmeier, who is not bad, but clearly not as experienced as a real doctor. Additionally the staff is usually very slow and rude and seems to be more concerned with gossiping about American Idol than attending to the task of expediting patients records and paperwork. Given the fact that this is such a small practice, one would expect faster service with more attention to detail, but sadly this is not the case. Dr. Brown seems willing to simply write a prescription rather than give a thorough exam. I had been on heart medicines for years that had some rather grave side effects and rather than seek alternatives or recommend a specialist Dr. Brown merely changed the dosage and then sent in his PAC to clean up and do the busy work of notating and scheduling a follow up appt. The fact that this office had no plan of action for improving my condition made them seem like nothing more than a glorified pharmacist.

She confirmed my suspicions by diagnosing Lyme Disease, and put me on a treatment program that helped. I believer she is a good clinician. However, she failed to inform me of the possible severe side effects of the medication, which resulted in my having to have surgery.

She did not make herself available when I needed her the most, despite repeated phone calls and was extraordinarily rude. I would not recommend her to anyone.

My eye does not close and croocked. Dr.Bachelor says it's fine, he does not even recognize what hi's done. Is it too much to ask from a plastic surgeon to do your eyes so that they have enough skin to close and not croocked&#63; Not in my world. He claims to be a classically trained portrait artist.

I've been going to Dr. Caswell for a couple of years. Yes, she has a very professional manner about her, but I don't think she is very good at diagnosing. She seems to push a lot of pills, and even when one statin med caused me muscle pain, she wanted to switch me to another identical med manufactured by a different company. In addition, several times she has appeared to guess at what was causing my unusual symptoms. She prescribed meds for those symptoms saying things like I'm going to try this on the chance that this is what's causing it. I am going to find another doctor because like someone else said, she is good at the basics but seems lost at the more advanced diagnosis. A very good doctor if you like getting lots of prescriptions. And she doesn't hesitate to send you to a specialist because she is at a loss.

I have been seeing Dr. Kubala for going on 4 years, and I've finally had enough. She is NEVER on time - my appointment yesterday was for 11 a.m. and I got into a room at 12:30 - and she is very curt. She has absolutely NO bedside manner skills. I was going to get tested for STDs and she made me feel very ashamed and embarassed just for being safe! I have always had terrible experiences with PAP smears, so painful I left sobbing, and I informed Dr. Kubala that I was very scared about it. Her response&#63; Well that's just what you have to get when you're sexually active. Gee thanks for the comforting, doc. She was, however, courteous enough to switch to a smaller speculum and even went out of her way to put KY jelly on it (of course, with the snide comment that she doesn't usually do this for everyone, but I'll make an exception for you). I've continued to see her because she knows my history and is very close by, but enough is enough. DO NOT SEE THIS DOCTOR!

I didn't like the way I was treated by Dr. Konsker the first time I went there. He was very abrupt, and the pap was very painful. I was very uncomfortable by the fact that he suggested that I had had many partners while it is not the case. He is not a good listener. He gets irritated and intimidating if I wanted to ask questions or for better explanations. When I asked him about certain pains I was experiencing he told me it was normal. I knew it didn't feel right and it made me very anxious. After I switched to another doctor who was patient enough to explain to me that it had to do with my overall prognosis and it could be dealt with through medication and knowledge. This was something that he could have taken the time to explain to me and help me avoid the pain and anxiety. So I am happy that I am seeing another doctor. I was left in the dark and made to feel bad for asking questions. The staff rude mostly.

Terrible experience all around. The wait time is the least of the problems, averaging 45 minutes. From the very first visit, I was told I needed 3 crowns. They did 2 already and very, very poorly. I've been going back over the past 2 months trying to have them fixed. Now I'm told I need root canals on both teeth instead and I may or may not have to pay for new crowns once the root canals are done. The dentist and staff are not attentive at all and treat patients like an assembly line that is making them money. I will NOT continue with this dentist and I DO NOT recommed him to anyone else, no matter what your insurace covers with his office. It's not worth all the pain and hassle. Besides, you end up paying much more in the long run.

She can be draconian if you question her course of treatment. A good physician should listen with an open mind and welcome questions.

She takes no insurance, and pushes the homeopathic products WAY too much. I'm all for trying something alternative but not multiple times if there are no improvements.

However, his manner towards me was condescending and unfriendly and it embarrassed me in front of my mother, whom he asked to accompany me to my second appointment. There must be a better, calmer way to suggest to a woman that she should have a hysterectomy. I believe that he speaks in this manner because he cares about people's health more than emotions, but he needs to tone it down. If I wasn't so taken aback by his manner, I might have made a follow-up appointment. As it was, I switched to another doctor.

This doctor is impersonal and strives to be in and out as quick as possible. I had 4 moles removed from my back. The thing that gave me anxiety was the different processes he used during each surgery. You would think he would have a system in place. For example, sometimes he would have me sign forms before the procedure, sometimes after. Things like that. On that last surgery he started cutting before I was completely anesthized, and when I told him I was in pain he said the procedure was almost over.

Dr. Sopher was great until I had a problem. She was a fabulous gyno. until I started having problems. After having no period for 9 months she funally believed me that something was wrong (not pregnant) and finally sent me for tests. Then once she discovered that I have polycistic ovarian disease, which she assured me over and over again that it was not the case, then she became no help at all. She even gave me the bad news over the phone, I was devasted to find out that I may not be able to have kids and she could only give me very limited information. When I called her later in the week to ask her about information that I found online she acted as though I was bothering her and could not give me any solid facts about my condition.

WARNING - This doctor is very abrupt and unfriendly. He was so rude it was amazing. He should not be practicing medicine. How can you trust a doctor that refuses to discuss his recommendations for more then ten seconds.

How he got into the best doctors of America list just goes to show how little you can trust that list!

Rude, arrogant, rushes through the exam. Always tries to get you back for another appointment when the results (if normal) can be relayed via telephone. Found another doctor who is much more patient friendly and just as qualified. Seems from reading these evals that you either love him or hate him. Maybe he is nice to some and rude to others, I don't know. I believe those who recommend him, everyones experience is different. BUT, mine (three visits) have all been pretty awful, so I have moved on. One thing is for certain, he is not a doctor that would respond well to a very shy patient (he will roll right over her) or a very strong willed one (he will be offended by your questions).

It's stressful just getting to her because you really do have to wait hours upon hours. It doesn't even work to take a day off from work and go early because it's ALWAYS crowded. But once you get to her she does fix you up. So only go to her if you're ok with the long and stressful waiting time. Her front desk people are kind of abrasive as well.

I am not impressed with the hours. There is no way to leave a message for the doctor, and they only take phone calls between 8am to 4pm, but stay open until 5pm. I work nights, so it is nearly impossible to reach someone when I need to. I needed to tell them where to get MRI info, and the after hours operator would not take a message. I scheduled my 1st appointment, after having ongoing chiropractic and pain management sessions with other doctors, and this doctor told me nothing, just asked questions, and then told me he needed my MRI pictures to continue, yet he was aware I had those pictures at least 2 weeks before I seen him because his fellow doctor from another office referred me. I don't think they have it all together.

Dr. Caswell is quite possibly the worst doctor you could see. I had to see her once when my doctor wasn't in. First of all, her medical assistant was very rude. Secondly, she is very rude, and I had a fever of 105,a sore throat and many other symptoms, well she wouldn't give me any antibiotics.So the next week I had to go back to my doctor and he had to gove me antibiotics. She could have saved me another trip to the doctor. Also she's more concerned about money than her patients. Please do not go to this doctor you will regret it.

Nasty man. Asked questions. Didn't wait for answers. Claimed he is the only GI that takes medical (lie). Was rude when I didn't answer quickly enough. He made a diagnosis without checking the emergency hospital records, other doctor notes & taking full answers from me. This doctor may be knowledgeable but made a diagnosis without sufficient information which makes negates his years of knowledge in my books. Add that to his rudeness & the rudeness of his staff & I'd give him about minus 20 out of 10. I've made an appointment with another GI who takes medical but who doesn't exist according to this arrogant mysogynist blowhart. Re mysoginist He made various comments such as when I asked a question he said if I told you, you'd probably develop the symptoms. In other words, woman=hypocondriac. He knew me for less than 2 minutes. On a good note, he inspired me to join this group & let others know about him. MY advice: Don't walk, run! Away!

Aside from the fact that a visit to Dr. Raghid averages a 2 hour wait, she is dismissive, unwilling to answer questions, and concerned only with billing my insurance company. She refused to change my method of birth control because my insurance is SLOW to pay (NOT because I wasn't covered) and was completely unwilling to answer any questions regarding problematic test results. It is true that she is friendly, as long as you have no questions or problems, no schedule to keep, and private insurance. The only thing that is order in this doctor's office is that they will ALWAYS remember to take your copay...other than that you're on your own.

Staff told me to wait to schedule appointment until just before I was going on extended leave out of state; doctor canceled appointment and refused to return calls when, after I was out of state, I needed refill on estriol cream prescription. After repeated calls, I was told doctor wouldn't refill because she hadn't seen me in a year -- despite the fact that I had done my best to make an appointment and had been seen 13 months previous. Might be a staff problem, but caused me much grief. She also tried to push Tamoxifen wo indications and despite counterindications (I have never had breast cancer, but do suffer vaginal atrophy.) I get the feeling she doesn't read my chart before she sees me, and misreads it even when it's in front of her. On previous visit, she thought I was taking the estriol orally. On the good side, she does seem remotely aware of alternative remedies (bioidentical hormones).

We felt that she was recommending unnecessary procedures given that we both had good dental health.

Totally unsatisfactory! Staff and doctor not pleasant at all. VERY disappointing. Seen this office for a year hoping each visit would be better. I can't believe I let myself cont. to see this doctor. The straw that broke the camel's back was a call I recently made to make an appointment. Doctor Caywood took the call and was also very curt. I was trying to be discreet of my situation. She had no empathy. Told me to just go to the emergency room if I felt I needed immediate attention. I did not sound like my situation required immediate care. She acted as if she didn't want to be bothered. I was in tears after hanging up the phone... plfft! Well, guess what, I will not bother Dr. Caywood and her staff anymore. In fact, she has lost my business. Because of this phone call w/Dr. Caywood, I will probably file a complaint against her. What a shame... :(

The above was paid in co-pays for a series of visits that ran during a 2 month period. While there were other issues being investigated, I saw this doctor for one particular complaint that was not properly diagnosed due to simple labs not being ran. I was told on 3 seperate appts. that this would be done, however it took a total of 4 visits to be diagnosed and given a scrip. I have been in the room and asked what another test result was, as if I would know, and told to ask a nurse, that time was ticking bascily and other patients needed attending. I always feel rushed and get asked to schedule another appt. if there are mutiple issues. It gets frustrating to waite so long and be treated like your on a five minute time line. I felt bed side mannor was certainly lacking, and often feel discouraged when I need to go back for anything.

Tried to use the wait and see approach on me as well, even though I had a 3-4 cm thyroid lesion of unknown pathology following an inconclusive biopsy at that hospital. Told me he'd take it out if I wanted him to and we could find out the pathology after my neck was cut open and the thyroid was thrown in a bucket. This hospital refused to give me my slides from the botched biopsy, but billed me for abnomal pathology. This doctor, his department, and the hospital are corrupt. Being polite and practical gets you nowhere with this morally bankrupt doctor and teaching hospital that has been alleged to also not bother giving the best care Baltimore's poorest citizens just as much as its wealthiest.

Refused to treat me with dignity and respect. Failed to inform me of life threatening condition that she and the nurse were both aware of. Ultrasound showed Fibroids. No Fibroids found during MRI. Adenomyosis evident positive histology reported during surgery with new OB. She told me nothing is wrong, go seek counseling. New OB found Adenomyosis and Interstitial Cystitis which was discovered in an office procedure that took 10 minutes as well as MRI that she failed to inform me of. Recommended by radiologist with ultrasound at her facility. She degraded me and refused to believe me. I requested my records and learned she wrote false statements in medical file which she refuses to correct. Billed me over $400 for one visit. No testing done other than urinalysis.

( Even though the main problem on that tooth was a cavity. That was it, I never went back to the man. Also his front desk lady, put the wrong code into my insurance, so I had to fight to get the money from him I deserved.

Dr. Shinn was on call and my daughter started breaking out into a rash. I called him and he said to give her Bendryle and call him if if doesn't get any better. With in 30 minutes it started getting worse so I called him back. I called him back to let him know it is getting worse. No sooner than me opening my mouth he yelled at me and said if I can't take his word for it then just go to the ER. I said that I was only doing what he asked me to do and I didn't like him yelling at me. He got very mean and rude and said then maybe I shouldn't be you doctor anymore! I said I agree! With in a week I recevied a letter stating he will no longer be servicing me as my doctor and I have 30 days to find a new one (in so many words). Come to find out the my daughter was allergic to the red die in the Bendryle I was giving her that Dr. Shinn said to give her. He didn't even care to listen to me that day.

I had this Dentist for five yr's now, and each time I can't belive my stupidy for seeing him. I have lost two teeth because of his unknowledge, this last time in August-06 , he gave me a small filing and it hurt like crazy when i left the office, it didn't before..I contacted his office and imformed them of this, make a appointment for 12:30 pm. Showed up,and after a small wait, was showed into the exam room, more x-rays, and was told by the Dentist he saw another small cavity that I had pointed out in Aug, got insulted when I mentioned it. He proceeded to give me a HUGE shot of novicain, came back in three minutes ,blew some air in the tooth, and since I felt that, gave me anothe shot. that didn't work either..So he told me he didn't have time to fix my tooth,Lunch time!..So there I was two shots of novicane, and now my tooth I belive is in need of a root canal!..which I can not afford..He admitted over and over that the cavity was small..and now I will lose the tooth, Thanks Dr.G!

At first, this doctor seemed OK. Multiple visits proved that pills were always the answer to every ailment, but not always the right answer. When the doctor could not see me, I went to another clinic.

I was very disappointed with my last visit with Dr Fugelstad. My Appointment was for 4:20 and did not see the Doctor until 5:00! He did not want to take the time to hear what I had been previously treated for. Once I had the opportunity to explain... he said Well what do you want me to do for you&#63; In the Medical profession, you should be concerned about your patients.. not aloof and self absorbed. You should treat your patients with compassion. That was the major thing lacking from this visit. That, and leaving you with an ambiguous answer as to what may or may not be going on.

This office by phone verbally criticized by families communications when inquiring about a $90 cancellation fee. If an appointment is canceled they neglected to tell us there is a $30 charge. They told us that it is Helthplexes POLICY&#63; Even if you reschedule the charge remains. This office wants to charge my daughter a cancellation fee of $30 after waiting in the dentists office when the doctor was not even present after 45 mins. So she told the clerk im leaving for school and have to reschedule for another time. A $30 cancel fee was applied when the doctor didn't show up for her appointment! As for my case I canceled an appointment by phone and asked to reschedule they said they will call me with the new appointment but never did. (mind you I have never been to this office before or even filled out the patient form) they want to charge me a $30 cancellation fee. I guess your not allowed to get sick and cancel an appointment without a $30 charge!

Great doctor IF you have an obvious diagnosis. If you have a URI or a muscle pull, he's your man. And he has that great, warm personality. However, I worked w/him for a couple years on several devestating, overlapping and admittedly curious symptoms, up to the point where I was the one desperately suggesting possibilites. He'd given up. Then he finally fired me and asked me not to come back. It was humiliating. He made ME feel like the failure. A subsequent doctor took the time, did a little research and correctly daignosed and treated 1) asthma, 2) adrenal fatigue and 3) insufficient dopamine. And she NEVER made me feel responsible or bad for not responding to the therapies she tried. She just kept at it until we figured it out and successfully treated it. Dr. George didn't have the time/interest/skills to do that and because of that I suffered many years more than I had to. If he doesn't know what your problem is, get out of there and find another doctor.

We were new to this dentist. My wife had an appt before me. She was told she had 5 cavities (very unusual for her). Also told her to put seal on many of her teeth at $50/tooth and to come for cleanings every 3 months for an extra $160/cleaning. Also told to see specialist about gum disease. I went to the same dentist for my first visit and was told that I had 1 cavity (I've had 1 cavity my whole life so I was a little suspicious, especially after my wife's 5 new cavities). It was also recommended that I put seal on about 18 of my teeth at $50/tooth and to come for cleanings every 3 months for an extra $160/cleaning. Also told to see specialist about gum disease. Sound familiar&#63; Have asked for copies of the xrays so we can have a second opinion and they keep promising but not delivering. Their recommendations certainly wouldn't be bad for our teeth, but they would be extremely costly. We were very uncomfortable with our experiences and are changing dentists.

Linda Marraccini is not a good doctor in my opinion. A doctor should be caring and humane as well as knowledgeable, she fails miserably at these. She has hurt the feelings of at least five people who have been her patients. She also does not do any kind of follow up on meds, you can be on BP medication for years she will not even review it. She is sadly lacking in any type of civility, least of all bedside manner. I wouldn't recommend her if she were a vet. Even her staff cannot stand her

Dr. Sjoberg is the dental equilvant to an ambulance chaser. He will do dental work on you to max out your benefits, whether need it or not. His motto is why waste it&#63;!

A horrible doctor who will prescribe you narcotic pain medicine at the drop of a hat. Cause me and mt family alot of pain by continually prescribe oxycotin and other narcotics when it was made aware that i had a addiction problem. Just cares about making money and its a matter of time before he ends up murdering someone with his mistakes.

She was not my regular dr in this practice but I needed to see her on a few occasions. The one that stands out the most - I was about 8 weeks into my pregnancy when I started to bleed heavily. They had me wait in the waiting room for an hour, at first she acted like I was being ridiculous and didn't take me seriously until she saw the amount of blood in the cup when they had me take my urine sample. As it turned out, my baby was fine and all she said was I can see no reason for the bleeding, just take it easy go to work and stay on your couch otherwise. However, after a few days I was still bleeding and starting to cramp. I went back, saw another Dr. in the practice who saw that I had a small tear in my placenta and ordered strict & total bedrest for at least 2 weeks. I do have to say she was the one the delivered my baby and did an excellent job on my c-section but I felt like I was forced into the section.

Waited over an hour for my son's appt. Asked why he was there. Told what he was diagnosed for 15 years previously. Wrote out a script for a dose four times the normal starting dose and said would see in two months. The waiting room was JAMMED with people most of whom, frankly, looked like they were doped up! We switched doctors and got MUCH better care!

I too agree with other posters and believe that Dr. Kritzer perhaps should not treat Thyroid,even diabetes. I belong to several thryoid support groups...and have become knowledgeable about my disease. I learned Nothing from Dr. Kritzer. He would answer questions for me, but add nothing. I found him cold and condesending, and my husband, who went to him once to be treated for his diabetes, wasn't impressed either. I totally agree with the other poster that he is not one to be a partner in a patient's health care!

Him and his nurse are completely unprofessional. For example, on a busy day I had an appointment w/ him. His nurse was unkind and pouty. The doctor made it seem like I was wasting his time. He isn't my normal doctor and since I was familiar with my illnesses, I knew what needed to be checked. As for him, I had to ask him to check my ears because he wasn't going to. On top of that, what he said was a complete shocker: I cannot perform all these diagnostic procedures, there's just not enought time. Sorry, I'm a paying customer and by my books, there's plenty of time. Why don't you try a different profession, the two of you, that is.

Dr does not communicate with patient. Only after going to another Doctor in Endocrinology, did I learn that Dr. Kritzer put me on a wrong dosage of thyroid medication; a dosage that nearly killed me. It was two dosages lower than I should have been on, and caused me to go into an arrythmia that lasted an entire night! I also learned how unknowledgeable he really is, after moving on to another Doctor of Endocrinology!

I've been going here for at least 8 years for recurring Lyme Disease and have just decided to stop seeing Dr. Gaito. She's gotten increasingly busy, less personable, less helpful, and she was never that friendly. Basically she's not interested in helping unless you are an open-and-shut textbook case. Talks constantly. Asks lots of questions but never says ANYTHING else -- what do my symptoms mean&#63; What's going on&#63; All she's ever done are blood tests and then tells me to call in for the results and leaves the room promptly, to the tune of $180+. Not that helpful, as evidenced by my 6th recurrance of the disease. She came highly recommended but I'd rather go to someone less recommended who will actually treat me like a person and HELP ME.

There are much better doctors in the area than Dr. Hines. His office staff is rude and he seems nice, but when an emergency happens, he is nowhere to be found. He talks the talk of being a caring doctor, but his actions show him to be more interested in seeing as many patients as possible and spending the least amount of time in the hospital as possible. There are much better doctors in the area.

Dr. DeVito is an extremely intelligent pediatrician. But unfortunately, he is like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He could be patient, thorough, caring and gentle for one visit and rude, unpleasant and obnoxious the next. I didn't know who I was going to get each time I called or when I took my daughter in to see him. He is definitely a poor choice for a pediatrician, especially if you’re a first time mom. Roughly, 2 years ago, just as I was about to leave their office, the practice hired an associate doctor, Dr. Gina Allegretti; she was the perfect pediatrician. and we all loved her. She just left their practice and so have I. Their other associates are horrible. Dr. Alvarado is the only doctor I would see but unfortunately, she is only in the Brooklyn office on Tuesdays and Thursday. Staff is just as moody and Dr. DeVito.

Dr.Levit is not a doctor at all. I mean there should be at least some concern for your patients. I developed rush as I came to her office in a hope to clear things out. Not only I had to wait for her to COME to work 2 hours later as appointments were suppose to be run on schedule. But she spends a few (literary) few seconds while staying away from as possible. And as I offer for her to see it closer, she assured me that her vision is very good from that distance. Meanwhile she told her stuff to give me 5 Rx. Later I found out that 4 of it were - steroids creams and they were contradicted to each other!!!! She is a business woman, but not a doctor...

Dr.Sobel is the most inconsiderate doctor in all of New York. I am a plastic surgery fanatic and by all means this doctor is the worst. I went into the office for lip injections which were silicone and permanent. He did them extremely wrong and now I have bad lips forever. He made them a different shape then what I asked for. I was so devastated and when I tried to tell him he ran away like a shy child. This doctor should not even be able to practice after all the stories I heard about him. He is just in it for the money that’s his number one concern. Do not see him for your own benefit.

I went to him for my first consult. My thoughts were well, he's the name I've heard the most on radio, tv, magazines, so he should be the best. So I go to the consult and I had asked to take the latest appt. b/c I wanted to take my time and make sure all my questions were answered w/o having anyone after me. Well, the consult was for 7:30pm and when I got there the place was packed. I sat for about 20 mins. and I was taken to an office where one of the girls told me how great he was and explained the proc., then he walked in and he told me how great he was. I asked him about sizes and he told me he would only make me a C (not what I wanted). When I asked him why, he said he was the best and I couldn't go any bigger. When I asked him about implant types, he said I didn't need to know about that, that he would decide what to use. This doctor is very arrogant and condescending and basically just wants to get you in, get your money, and get you out. Needless to say I went w/ another doc.

This doctor is one of the worst doctors i know!!! She has NO patience for her patients, she rushes, make mistakes constantly that she needs her liscence revoked. Not only is she never on time the waiting period for her is approx. 3 HOURS!!! And the explanation for the wait is I had a lot of patients that needed the ultrasound room. Mind you she has 3 rooms but only one room has that machine. Then if that is the case dont schedule patients back to back for that room. But when i left one of the girls referred me to a differnet doctor by the name of Dr. Rashmi Acharya in Plainsboro. And her ratings on this site are remarkable!! Check them out!!!

I went to see this doctor a number of times with stomach pains. He did not stress the seriousness of my possible condition. I put things off. He was very agreeable rather than assertive. He will prescribe pretty much whatever (can't blame doctors too much for that b/c we've trained them to give us the prescriptions we want). However, my appendicitis went undiagnosed for 8 months. I had warning signs in my blood work, in my symptoms and in the descriptions I gave him. I needed a cat scan, but put it off b/c of the cost. He reassured me that if I felt ok, I was ok. I was on antibiotics which hid the infection. I wound up hospitalized for 2 weeks after my gyno found the infection in the appendix. So much for the internist. He is a nice guy and felt bad about it later and he did follow up with me in the hospital. Appendicitis is actually very difficult to diagnos, but I felt there were adequate warnings.

And I started having contraction at 28 weeks I called the office and told the receptionist that I thought I was having contractions she said Dr. Sasaki was with patients but that she would call me right away, she never called! I went to the ER later that same night and was admitted right away. I at that point transfered care to another doctor and while I was in the hospital she never even rounded with me.I don't understand how a women who specializes in this field would provide this type of care.I wouldn't recommend her in my opinon.

He was rude, stressed, and got annoyed when asked perfectly simple questions.

Dr. Kilgo rarely sees patients on time, scheduling 8 to 10 people for an appointment at the top of an hour; the last of those 8 or 10 must wait at least an hour to see the doctor -- often spending only two minutes with him once in his back office.

Office staff was recently overhauled and has made going there painful in so many ways. The new hygienist learned her trade in a Soviet Gulag. They constantly try to overcharge for services even though my insurance has remained the same for several years. The last time I had a tooth filled I was in the chair for two hours because apparently filling it once was not good enough, so he drilled it out and did it again. He is as gentle as a lamb because he uses enough Novocaine to choke a horse and then goes at you like a wild banshee. Although this isn't as bad as the hygienist and her sandblasting treatments to clean the coffee stains off! She not only cleans the stains but gets a pint of blood too!

Dr. Larkin has changed and not for the better. She appears to be very caught up with things. She was not paying attention to anything I said. I asked twice for renewals on my medications and she still forgot. She sent a letter to her patients and introduced a semi concierge type plan for 1000. In a true concierge practice the physicians have 600 patients. That is not the case in this practice, she has a very full practice. Those of us who opt not to pay 1000. will now wait even longer to see her. The wait time now is 2 to 3 months. I have not sent in my money this year for the 300. plan because I am weighing other options. Her staff is not very professional and on Wed. they allowed a woman to bring in her dog. Which really is not permissible unless it is a service animal which clearly this wasn’t. They lack judgment,and frequently don't abide by HIPAA guidelines. She should invest money into better office staff and not a new office.

He is an overall great Dr, the only thing I can say negative was I did not get my yearly pap on time and was actually a couple months past the time and that seemed to upset him and the pap was very painful, I felt he Intentionally made it painfull, I had never had pain with him previously and I had been going to him for over 5 years.

I'm a 4 year patient of Dr. Kubala's. I had an appointment in April for which I took my lunch hour from work in order to attend. I ended up waiting 2 1/2 hours to be seen.

I got a few words out when a nurse interrupted for the doctor to take an urgent phone call. She left my chart in the room with me and left to take the call...never to return. She forgot about me! The staff was very apologetic, but I gathered up my chart, took it to checkout and demanded not to be charged for the visit. Nobody should have to wait 2 1/2 hours and then to top it off...being forgotten! Needless to say, I've taken my personal care elsewhere and will never return to her office again.
