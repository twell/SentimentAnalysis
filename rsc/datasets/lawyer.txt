I do not know anything about politics but this judge is not fair.  If he favors a law firm,  he will try and give assistance at trial to the favored firm by letting the other side ask any question they want and by letting all their irrelevant evidence in and he will not give the same lattitude to the not favored other side.  People have to know what really goes on and contact your political party leaders to ask questions.  They are allowing the bottom of the barrel to get on the Judiciary Bench in NYS.  Apparently this Judge does not care about the children of litigants and the importance of children's well-being to become productive members of this society.  This is a shame and he should be held accountable for not caring about children.  In addition, this Judge does not care about the proposition live within your means and that this should be taught to children.  He favors the non working and non productive rich against the hard working person with good morals and ethicss. Disgrace!

This woman is a monster - she illegally garnishes the wages of men who have always paid their child support. The Los Angeles Times (July 2006) recently reported how she trivialized the fact that her department kept an abused child was hidden from her father for more than a decade - the father and the daughter are now suing Cruz and the Los Angeles County Child Support Services Department (Do a Google Search for Dad, daughter separated by negligence) and Cruz fought a California Supreme Court Ruling that would require that her corrupt agency stop collecting bogus child support from men who were NOT the fathers of the children that Cruz was stealing from (again, do a Google search for the Washington Times Article entitled, Court asked to 'depublish' child-support ruling)

I was charged with a DUI driving some friends back to their apt. and got pulled over for rolling a stop sign.  I was scared out of my mind what would happen, but Michael Richmond was so helpful in handling this situation for me and reduced the charges significantly.  I would recommend him to everyone!

This attorney faild to file the court order in a timely fashion (never filed the oppsing attorney filed it 3 1/2 months later) and left us in contempt of court.  He also failed to communicate with us about what he was doing and made agreements with the opposing attorney without our knowledge. He refused to answer our question regarding the case.  Now he has decided that he is not going to finish the case that we have paid for. We are reporting this one to the SC Bar.

DUI almost ended my 20 year career.  Michael Richmond got me the very best result possible.  Not only did I avoid getting terminated at work, I kept my drivers license. I have heard countless horror stories from others who didn't get a good lawyer.  Mr. Richmond was very dilligent.  His team were respectfull and non-judgemental.  I would recommend him to everyone who is arrested for DUI in San Diego.

I have had a very bad business relationship with Attorney, Erwin Dunlop.  He erronously charged me with over $75,000.  He used my credit card number from a previous retainer.  The case in now in investigation with my credit card company, the police department, and also the Florida Bar.I condsider Mr. Erwin Dunlop a very dishonest man.  I will prove all that I say.  I have all my records.  He had no authorization to charge my credit card company $7500.00 with out my concent or permission.  Though this is what Erwin Dunlop did, Winter Park, FL.  I shall persue this case, stating he is a liar and a thief.  Just because he is a lawyer, he can not take advantage, and fraud, of an innocent lady. J.W.

Ms. Steiner always answered my questions in depth, and further explained things in terms I could comprehend.  Her call back response time is always speedy and her accessibility is not what I have encountered before!  I'm so glad I hired her to get me through a very tough ordeal!  Thank you Ronee!

Lori Cruz filed a complaint against me claiming my daughter was collecting welfare in Los Angeles, while my daughter lives with me in Orange County. Lori Cruz was well aware that Los Angeles County was conducting a fraud investigation against my ex husband. Lori Cruz lied on court documents and misrepresented material facts. My ex husband had collected welfare frauduently, while he owes me $14,000 in support. Lori Cruz refused to collect my child support but wanted me to pay for my ex husbands fraud. I have found out that my ex husband only lied about his income and told child support services he was the non custodial parent. Yet Lori Cruz continued thoughtout the action to lie to the court and tell them I was the non custodial parent. She should be thrown out of the state bar association.

The Law Offices of Michael Richmond were a blessing for me.  I was arrested for a DUI (0.10) with Falsifying Information.  I am in the military, so this would have ruined my career.  But, I contacted this lawyer instead and saved myself from a bad situation.  From the get-go, all my questions were answered.  They were fair, honest and supportive of me at all times, and were always quick and responsive with anything that I needed.  The end result was receiving a wet reckless, and my military career is saved.  If anyone I know is ever in this situation, I will insist that they use the Law Offices of Mr. Richmond!

Setting aside the pain and hardships his own family, unfortunately, will also suffer does not excuse or justify Mr Jan Kabas' illegal and unethical actions. Mr. Kabas is solely responsible for that by his own actions.  Nor does it erase or excuse, not only the illegal and unethical actions that he must presently answer to, mortgage fraud and predatory child sexual related charges, but the countless other actions that wrecked havoc upon and ruined the lives of other clients who depended upon him to achieve the justice that they too deserved and that he had an obligation to provide. Mr. Jan Kabas has many other clients that will, forever, regret the day they met Jan Kabas and he should never be permitted to have his law license reinstated.

I retained Ronee Korbin Steiner as my attorney to handle my divorce that was settled in March, 2007.  I was referred to her by a mutual friend and my experience with her was excellent.  I found her to be very professional and knowledge about the proceedings and my legal rights.  She took the time to fully understand my situation and provided guidance on the directions and actions she thought we should take, while at the same time listening to my position and concerns.  Like most divorce’s, my ex and I had very different positions on how the assets should be split.  Ronee dealt with my ex’s attorney very professionally, while at the same time remaining firm and ensuring that I was well represented.  Anyone going through a divorce will experience a difficult time regardless of the situation and circumstances.  Her representation was invaluable and I would highly recommend her.  Good Luck.

Just read today that this (ex)lawyer has been disbarred, I believe effective April, '06. Usually, I don't take pleasure in other peoples misfortunes, but in the case of Mr. Kabas I can only say, without hesistation, that justice has been partially served. I don't know the disposition or sentencing of the  criminal charges that 1) he had pled guilty to or 2) the pending mortgage fraud charges. But, hopefully justice will be further served.

The disposition of this lawyer, his characteristics and poise = Power. He is not a senstionalist nor a bully. He wins his cases based on knowledge and understanding of his client and not to mention his beliefs in the client.  I thank Tom for working with Michael Jackson as I felt if Michael maintained the previous lawyer that it might have been the successful turn out Tom won...regardless that Michael is an innocent man.  I like Tom's silents to the press and power in the court room!!

I have been a client for over 2 yrs. & am extremely satisfied with the services provided by Richard.  My calls are returned & he stays in close contact with my local attorney.  Richard has never forgotten any detail about my case.  As an attorney, Richard is brilliant, extremely ethical & honest; a rare combination these days.  Does Richard have faults&#63;  Of course, we all do.  But I would say Richard's might be that maybe he cares so deeply about protecting as many abused children as possible that maybe he spreads himself a bit too thin.  Nobody in the world has the advanced skills to deal with these complex, horrific issues like Richard Ducote. I have the utmost respect for Richard and I don't regret for one second trusting him with my daughter's life.  All I know is that I would rather have a little of Richard than no Richard at all.

I have been very disappointed with the Law Office of Spar & Bernstein. My case is complicated and I received a promise that did not come true. They are very expensive but the price would be worth it if the service was above par. I can never get a paralegal on the phone when I have a question. If I do get one, I won't get the same one twice. The receptionists are not even the slightest bit polite or helpful. I am incredibly disappointed with my whole experience (client since 2003).

Ms. Korbin-Steiner handled my divorce for me, and I will be forever grateful for being in her good care during such a frustrating, tumultuous ordeal.  She is honest, straightforward, and no-nonsense; but she is real people as they say. I have dealt with numerous attorneys over the years for various situations, and I have NEVER had another attorney consistently reply to my inquiries almost IMMEDIATELY. My normal experience is to call, leave a message, e-mail ... and then wait, and wait, and WAIT for a response from my attorney.  Not Ronee.  You call her, and 9 out of 10 times she actually ANSWERS her phone.  You leave a message, and 100% of the time she returns the call within an hour or two at the MOST. You e-mail her, and you WILL hear from her that very same day.  She is extraordinary in her knowledge of her field, as well as how she interacts with her clients.  Her clients are not just cases with blank faces and dollar signs.  They are PEOPLE about whom she cares. She is the BEST.

THIS ATTORNEY WAS THE OPPOSING ATTORNEY IN MY DIVORCE.  HE BLATENTLY LIED TO THE COURT AND USED EX PARTE INFO ON MY EX'S BEHALF.  HE TOOK MONEY FROM A JOINT ESCROW ACCOUNT AGAINST A COURT ORDER AND USED IT FOR MY EX'S LEGAL FEES.  HAS LIED THROUGHOUT DIVORCE MATTER AND NEVER SUPPLIED ME WITH STATEMENT FROM ESCROW.  IN HIS AFFIDAVIT OF SERVICES WHICH I NEVER RECEIVED A COPY OF UNTIL I WENT THRU COURT FILES HE STATED MY EX COULD ONLY PAY HIM $8000.  I PROVED TO THE COURT THAT MY EX PAID MORE WITH CANCELLED CHECKS.  HE FILES THINGS AND PUTS DOWN THAT HE COPYS YOU BUT HE DOES NOT.  MY ATTORNEY DIED AND HE WAS SUPPOSED TO PUT MONEY FROM ESCROW ACCOUNT IN AN INTEREST BEARING ACCOUNT.  HE STATED THAT I NEVER SENT A W9.  HE ALSO STATED THAT MY DEAD ATTORNEY AGREED THAT HE COULD USE MONEY FROM THE ESCROW ACCOUNT.  HE ALSO WROTE AN OBJECTION LETTER RE PENSION ARREARS OWED ME STATING I COLLECTED ARREARS WHICH WAS FALSE, THE JUDGE APPLIED LIE TO FINAL DECREE AND MY FIRM DID NOT DEFEND ME.

Always very professional and courteous.  She returns all calls and answers any inquiries with sophistication and knowlede.  Her sence of fairness and work ethic are unmatched.  I feel that everytime time I have needed her services, she has fought and argued my case with a sence of urgency.  This level of attention to detail is rarely seen in an industry that is easily clouded with pretension and arogance.

I have had nothign but great dealings with Mrs. Woo. She ALWAYS returns my calls or e-mails the same day. Mrs. Woo is a very logical and honest person with a genuine good heart that cares about her clients. I live in Elk Grove and i drive 1 hour+ to her office thats how good she is. She has never once rushed me and has always given my case the Proper attention necessary. When you go into her office they even have toys and things for your children to do. I would recommend her to my famil, friends and others. If you want a lawyer that takes her time and cares about your case you will choose Corecia Woo

Very proffesional in every way.  I have been in court and out of court in all types of legal situations in which I wanted to get physical in the hallway and she (Ronee) has never acted in any way but appropriate, and always has been the calming inlfuence on the situation.  Who ever the person is that said she (Ronne) wanted to get into a physical altercation in a hall is obviously under the influence of drugs, OR more likely is someone with an agenda because Ronee defeated them in court.

I hired Attorney Reidy to represent me in a divorce/custody hearing.  That was 5 years ago.  It was not an easy case.  I was amazed at her level of dedication, professionalism and caring.  Needless to say, thanks to her hard work and legal expertise, I was awarded custody of my children and was able to obtain a divorce.  She returned every call I made to her.  She is a woman who gives the legal profession a human face.  I would and have recommended her to anyone in need of a lawyer.  I still retain her as my attorney.  She was my lawyer for my first real estate closing.  As always, she had only my best interests in mind.  She made this process easy.  Although, I do not have a huge need for legal services, I would not trust anyone but her.

Brilliant is an understatement; this guy can out-think any judge and any opposing counsel on most any issue.  His fees are reasonable and he works 15+ hours days on a regular basis.  He is the uber advocate.  That said, his workload overwhelms him at times, interferring with his availability for hearings, and resulting in horrible communication with his clients.  On the whole, my recommendation is to suck-up the unreturned calls and retain Brent and focus on the big picture.

THE BIGGEST SNAKE IN THE GAME!  Make sure this evil person is on your side.  I interviewed 5 new lawyers, all told me the same story:  If you are going up against Toni Cherry in Judge Ammermans court room, even if you win, you will still lose.  She wins cases which shouldn't have stood a change in front of Ammerman (wonder why).  She will say anything, and do anything to win, she has flat out fabricated stories about me every time I have faced her.  But don't expect a hearing when scheduled, she will delay, postpone, request continuances, recommend other actions for every hearing.  All attorneys I have spoke with in the area hate her because she procrastinates and is so disagreeable.  I have faced her as a single father 12+ times and lost every single time.  No criminal record, no history of any sort, and I have had minimum visitation and maximum support from day one.

He is the one. words can't describe how angry and upset I am now. This person ruined my wedding.I and my fiance decide to have a pre-nup. my fiance let this lawyer to write it. that is where the nightmare started. He sent us the first draft very quick. when we looked into it, we found out that was just a template with a lot of misspelling. my lawyer told me that he spent no more than 3 minutes to do it. of course we were not happy. we asked him to make some changes. after that, we never can get him again. my fiance called him for weeks but he never picked up the phone and never return the phone call.Last Friday he finally called us back and PROMISED us he would get the job done on Monday because Wednesday is our wedding ceremony. Now is Tuesday afternoon, we don't see anything from him and he disappers again. I don't think I can get married tomorrow.

For the competitive fee she asks for, she doesn't have a speciality even in filling up the forms. If the client is from Canada, she writes Denmark even though she had been talking with me (Her client) for number of months. If you email her, first of all you get your reply in weeks, and then if you ask a question very specific and clear, she doesn't address your question. I have no idea why she charges money. Does she charge money to write her name in the attorney column of the form&#63; She never answers her phone. She has a very irresponsible secratory who don't care that her silly mistakes can cost another number of months. I believe that her law firm does this intentionally so that Client would be continuously worried, and the case would never be resolved and her law firm would be making money out of the Client. I have become her victim and I don't want anybody else to be her or hers law firm's victim, that is why I am writing this review. I would never recommend this Lawyer for anythin

I feel ripped off. I was charged an amount nerly 3 times the amount quoted for his services, and he didnt do half the work which was included in the original quote. I feel as if I did the majority of the work for my case. In one instance, I even had to represent myself because he would not return my calls regarding a very time sensitive matter that was caused because he did not file all the paperwork necessary for the case. This was after months of calls reminding him to do it. He is not personable and quite rude sometimes. My case was ruled in my favor, not due to his work, but due to the other party giving up and in because they realized they could not win. Even with this, he still overcharged me. After nearly a year of trying to contact him regarding payment and billing, he still hadnt responed to me. Then he sends a demand letter for payment WITH interest and not a full breakdown of the charges as requested. I feel that he was the biggest waste time and money.

It is about time that this woman was disciplined by the State Bar. She has a terrible reputation as an attorney, among friends, clients, and now State Bar. Per her disciplinary report (read online), she even falsified documents to the Bar. Thought I had already seen how low she could go. At times, I thought she must have some psychological issues, because of her pathological lying. Didn't she know one day she would reap what she has sown&#63; Glad to see that she has finally gotten her just desserts, although I think her suspension period should have been longer.

Although Mr. Ducote knows these situation's better than anyone, he has not been following through in many of his cases including my own. He requires outrageous retainers ( I paid 2 retainers early 2004: one in the amount of $25,000 for an appeal that has never been filed,nor has the money been refunded as requested. The second in the amount of $75,000 for trial court representation, and he has yet to appear. For $80,000,I have found myself in a Pro Se position ).I am very disappointed with Mr. Ducote, as well as many others around the country. While I was fending for myself in court, he was traveling to hearings that he was not paid to represent, and has offered approximately two days of free consultation to a case in California. Then followed up with a contract that required a $40,000 retainer. All the while neglecting his paid and contracted cases. I haven't seen or heard of any positve results from any of his cases in the past couple of years to include my own.

Please please do not waste your money on her. She talks a really good game, but she will do anything to get more money from you. She didn't know my case at all and was completely unprepared. I wasted $10k, because she kept promising the world. Please do not use her, your case will be worse off, I know mine was. I gave her a $5K retainer, and then $5K more, but my child support case was never even heard. Good luck to you all, just please don't go this route!
