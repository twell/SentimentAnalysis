This was my daughter's 2nd year at the camp and she just loved it.  Next year I will send her for 3 or 4 weeks.  The overall experience was a good one for her.  I find YMCA Camping Services to be a warm, nurturing, safe environment for my daughter and I would recommend this camp to friends, relatives and assosiates.

Hiawatha Youth Camp is the best place ever. Everyone in the WORLD should go there. This is the place where I found Christ and so did many others. I have only went once but I am definitely going again this year. I would like to see the people I met last year (like Guthrie :D) and my old councelors. I get to go in two months and I can't WAIT!!!

I was a program counselor at this camp, and from looking at other camps, this one had great facilities (eg, most camps dont have bathrooms in each cabin).  I have some great memories, and still hear from some of my campers, and friends from around the world!  However, I thought that there was MORE drama w/ the counselors than w/ the campers! It felt like middle school, all the gossip of who is hooking up with whom...and some counselors putting their personal life over being there for their campers.

Best camp in the world. Its hard to explain how much this camp has changed my life over the last 6 summers.  As a 10 year old going with my brother and his frind, I was some what scared, but the counselors and other campers at The Nest welcomed me into the community and made me crave coming back after each three week session. Each camper learns a new meaning of freindship, cummunity, and family when they attend camp that can only be defined by expirience. If there is any question of whether or not to go to this camp, just go, and if you dont like it then it is not for you but I will find that really hard to believe with the kind of camp Eagles Nest is. Each summer I have matured as a member of society and as a human being. This once again is the best camp that you will find.

If you don't believe in magic you've never been to Skylark. Camp magic is what its all about and its everywhere from the redwoods to the awesome staff and campers who return to skylark every year. If you leave loving the place even half as much as I do you will not regret it.

I was a camper at Pontiac from 1997 to 2005.  I finished the entire 8 year cycle as a camper repeating my freshman year because I was too young to move on.  Pontiac was always my home and each summer was another opportunity to make new friends and have a blast.  The negative comments posted about Pontiac are comments that referred to the latest years of the camp's operation in which I felt the rules became a bit more than anyone could handle and the atmosphere of the entire campus changed.  Pontiac was a great place but it has suffered from the owners insistence that bigger is better and tours are the most important thing.  The counselors are great and the friends you make are friends you'll have for life.  If you can look beyond the beauracracy of Pontiac you can find a place where the music stops and our heartbeat rests on the mountain tops...away from the city I'll be back, away from the city Pontiac!

My daughters have been going to these camps for the last three year.  The first two were great the last was horrible for my young daughter.  1st there were a set of twin girls that were bullies.  My daughter informed the counselor about an incident and the counselor responded negatively with, Stop Being A Cry Baby.  It was so bad that she informed the counselor to give us a call because she wanted to be picked and the counselor never responded to her wish.  Secondly, my daughter fell down a scraped her knee very badly.  She informed the counselor about it and the counselor did not take her to the nurse.  This, we feel, is unacceptable because the wound should have been cleaned and treated.  I can't understand how the counselor could have been so insensitive to these two incidents.  May daughter also informed us that the bathrooms were discusting. She has decided not to go to this camp again.  It must have been a bad year for this camp since this had not happend in the premvious year.

I've been going to west hills for like 5 years now and I'm a CIT (counselor in training) which means I work half a day and play half a day. It's cool I like most of the activities but I wish we could like go on trips outside of camp. Most of the people who work there are ok but there are a lot of wannabees and stuff but some of the staff are really nice too especially steve the group leader of the t-chiefs OMGHH and me and my friends are his entourage. I don't know if I will go back next year I might if I could be a counselor.

When your younger I have to say the camp is amazing but when you get older I didn't like it that much. I go to the Ranch Camp there and I recomend anyone to go there it it like a family and you will want to come back every year. this was my last year and I am so sad that I didn't start when I was 12 instead of when I was 13. Many people have said that its to christian I have to say that some of the stuff is like you say grace but im Jewish and that doesn't get in the way of me having a great time at camp!!!

This camp is probably the best and most life changing place I have ever been. It feels more like a home to me then my real home, and I love it there.

There is a variety of activities to participate in so there is something for everyone.  Both of my daughters were long time campers at Scherman and also worked summers as staff ~ I can't wait until my granddaughter is old enough to be a camper at Scherman!

My daughter just came home from her first year at Camp Pontiac and cannot stop talking about it!  She had the best time and made great friends.  Most of the girls in her group are from New Jersey and Florida, with a few from NYC, LI and Westchester, not just LI.  The facilities are amazing and so much money is put back into the camp.  As far as being a sports camp, my daughter is not an athlete and was busy all summer trying all kinds of activities not just sports.  It is also not as jappy as everyone makes it out to be- we saw many camps that were way jappier than Pontiac. The owners may put on quite a show, but they can stand behind everything they say.  They truly enjoy the kids and the camp, and it is evident after spending a summer there.  I would not send my kids anywhere else.

As a former camper and staff member of the former Cove Camp, there is not anything bad I can say!  The camp staff had a huge impact on my life, both spiritually and in everyday areas.  This is one of the main reasons why I chose to work at the Cove Camp myself.  The staff is truly dedicated to the work of Christ and everything that they are doing.  The camp in general always seems to be growing and offering more programs/activities for its campers.  It is because of these things that campers want to return year after year!  Thank you for your dedication and I'm SO glad camp is opening back up this year!  K. Hamilton

Merriwood is AMAZING!!! the counselors are approachable and nice, the campers are friendly and enthusiastic, and the camp directors do everything in their power to make camp an unforgettable experience. many of my best memories come from camp and i can not even describe the people ive met and the once in a lifetime experiecnces i've had. the traditions are amazing, and the oldest campers have the oppurtunity to bring enthusiasm and fun to the camp trough their many priveleges. camp merriwood is an incredible place and i would not give up my five summers for anything. it is truly an out of this world experience and i can not imagin going to camp anywhere else. seven weeks may seem like a long time but it going by so fast that you wish you could stay longer. merriwood provides an unmatchable camp experience and there is no camp better than merriwood. in order to understand the merriwood magic you must be part of it. i would encourage everyone to experience merriwood. it is AMMAZING!!!!!!

I have been to many camps over the past several years and Oconto is my favorite. It is a great enviroment for girls of all ages to be themselves, have fun, and make new friends without the pressures of everyday life. There is a large variety of activities and opportunities. There seems to be something for everybody. The staff are all very professional and caring. And the cabins/zebos (half cabin half screen) are beautiful. Best camp ever!

I went as a camper and a counselor, and FA is one in a million. I'm 23 now, and my best friends are still my cabin mates from FA. I think the person who gave FA a bad rating is the same person rating it over and over again, and probably has bad social skills and poor hygiene and maybe couldn't make any friends&#63;&#63; Not sure, but I've never before heard anything negative about FA. My kids are going there when I eventually have kids. My whole life I always wished I could explain to people how amazing my camp was, but it's so hard to describe. I did try another camp at one point...Robindel...it was NOT good in comparison. FA far exceeds all expectations. Your kids will be so active and creative and happy and make so many lasting friendships. It is such a valuable and enriching environment, and really helped shape me into who I am today, and gave me such confidence.

Choosing a camp for your son or daughter is a massive decision and should never be taken lightly. You need to be assured that you child is going to be safe, cared for, eat well and experience something special.  Well I assure you Forest Acres is nothing short of MAGIC!!.  I was lucky enough to experience a summer along the Sarco River and have done everything possible to get back to Maine and Forest Acres every summer.  The unique spirit that FA fosters encourages every camper to try their best and step outside their comfort zone,  all while knowing they are in the constant care and support of others. FA encourages girls to have ‘Strong Minds and Gentle Hearts’. Thanks F.A for all the love, support and strength you have given.  The pine trees will be forever in my heart and I can not wait for the day I can once again ‘hug a pine tree’.

POINT O PINES IS MY LIFE AND I LOVE IT WITH ALL MY HEART SO IF ANYONE IS THINKING OF GOING THERE OR SENDING THEIR CHILD HERE..

THERE IS NO PLACE ANYONE WOULD RATHER BE THAN THE INCREDIBLE POINT O' PINES. SERIOUSLY I CANNOT EXPLAIN HOW AMAZINGLY PHENOMINAL ALL MY SUMMERS HAVE BEEN AT THE POINT.. IVE BEEN THERE FOR 6 YEARS AND I STILL HAVE 2 TO GO AND I CANT WAIT TO CONTINUE ON TO BE A PEAKER, BUT IT MAKES ME CRY TO EVEN HAVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA THAT I WILL EVER EVER EVER HAVE TO LEAVE MY SUMMER HOME.. THE STAFF IS AMAZING.. THE GIRLS ARE PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULD NEVER FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THEY BECOME YOUR BEST FRIENDS RIGHT AWAY.. THE CAMP LETS YOU CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT, BE WHO YOU WANNA BE AND DO THE RIGHT THING. SO GO TO POINT O PINES AND HAVE THE BEST TIME EVER BECAUSE SERIOUSLY. ITS THE BES

It was years ago when I went to Oconto, but I remember it vividly.  It was one of the best summers I have had.  I plan on sending my daughter their there when she is of age.

I was a staff member at this camp back in the late 80's.  I can't speak on this camp today, but they have the Same Director today as they did 20 years ago.  I can speak from experience that the kids come first here.  Their Spitirual and Physical well being are paramounty.  I can truly say that at the end of each session, I felt like I had 10 new little brothers. Now 20 years later, I still long for my days as a counselor at Camp Ridgecrest.  I would love to work there full time...sincerely,  Bashful Beaver (Raleigh, NC)

I went for 1 summer  and never went back. It just wasnt the camp for me. Alot of kids only stay for 2 or 3 weeks so there are always kids coming and going. counselors are ok but overall not a very well run camp. I dont agree with the last statement the bunks were GROSS!! There are so many other better camps out there especially for the money they charge.

This was my daughter's first experince with sleep away camp.  The activities she particpated in where wonderful and she had nothing but good things to say about the activities.  There were however a few down sides to her experience. She informed me that one of her counselors was very mean to her.  She also said there was one night she was not feeling well and requested to see the nurse however this particular counselor said no.  Luckily the other counselor was sympathetic and allowed her to go.  This could be very dangerous and a possible liability to the camp. Had my daughter been seriously ill, this counselor would be responsible for denying her medical attention.  The other issue is that my daughter informed me that only one stall in the girls' bathroom worked, the others were clogged with ****.  This is absolutely unacceptable which is why I gave a low facilities score.  My daughter does not wish to return next summer specifically because of this one counselor.

Our son is currently in his third year at CR. This year, at 11, he said he wanted to go for 4 weeks. At the half-way point, mom and I made a surprise visit to see him and what we found was a semi-clean young man coming of age. There he was sitting in the cafeteria eating a sandwich and watching the craziness of all the new campers checking in. His voice was coarse, his stare that of a someone who had seen too many wonderments in too short a time. I always find it amazing how much he grows while away at camp, but this year it hit me particularly hard - he's already talking of staying longer next year, and if he decides this course, I see no other action than to support it. Ridgecrest is just one of those very special places that brings together the very best of everything (staff, activities, leadership, and just plain fun) and each year we do not spend the money thinking of it as an expense, but rather an investment. Camp Ridgecrest is an incredible place where a boy can just be a boy!

Ive heard the expressionthe Patty cake camp...Thats what the kids do all day while they wait on lines to do activities.  For the money I spend there it seems they should work on their scheduling a bit more or make the groups smaller.  Its overwhelming there(too many children and not enough activities).  That makes their monetary value very low.

I have been going to tanamakoon for eight years now, and if you're interested in helping your daughter to build lasting relationships, this is the place to send her.She will meet amazing friends who will be with her for her lifetime, however, tanamakoon does have some shortcomings.It is a very traditional camp and  it does not have very many activity options, and those that are availible become boring as the girls get older. There is a lot of emphasis on structure and gaining awards which can add stress to a place where young girls should just be able to have fun. I personally think that the costs for this camp are too expensive, and you pay way too much for what you get (although,the food service and tripping are excellent).I would not continue to return to this camp if i had not started young and made such amazing friends, because i would be lost without them for a whole summer. I love this camp, but for the people in it and the environment, not the strict rules.

i was probably if not one of the most awesome counselors in the staff of 07 i cant really say how much this camp has given me being a former camper gave me a greater insight of how a counselor can shape a young persons life its like its a total mind blow to see how quick the kids take to their counselors. well i can really just remember my times at camp and how much i loved all of the staff but most especially my counselor and now that there are two counselors per- cabin i think that lightens up the work load immensely  and i as the only last standing male American staff of 07 would really just like to say i CANT WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR BUDDIES --MARINO CAMP TALCOTT COUNSELOR OF 07 THE GREATEST YEAR SO FAR

i beg to differ with anyone who has a problem with camp marston. i have been going there for about 8 years now and the reason i keep coming back is the wonderful staff and wonderful activities. they keep you busy. i am now to old to attend marston as a camper but am waiting for summer to begin, so i can become a councior for the camp i grew up with. i can honestly say that marston has shaped me as a person. i have wonderful friends that i have seen every year at marston and who i met at marston, who agree that marston is truely amazing. the staff care about the children and make sure that everyone has an amazing time. there is singing every morning and night at flag and at the end when the week is through there is  a candleight ceremony  where u can reflect on your week. my last candlelight ceremony as a camper was truley amazing....my last year as a camper and all the previous years will never be forgotten...marston is truly one of a kind.

FWF 07' is gonna be even better than 06' even though i had an unbelieveable time. Ron,Isaac,Larry,Beth, the whole F.W.F staff is great. If your looking for a camp where every1 fits in and has an amazing time, no mattter how differnt they are, french woods is your camp. About 95% of the campers who go there, love it and come back for years. French woods makes my life complete and idk what i would do without it, thank you every1 (friends,staff,family etc.) for giving me the best 5 summers of my life. cant wait till 07' baby yeah!!

Point O' Pines camp is the absolute best place to spend your summers in. It's bueaty is breathtaking. I have developed amazing friendships that will last me a life time at this camp. The fact that i cant go back next summer is extremly depressing. Just thinking about not being able to be with my 29 summer sisters at our home is making me tear up. There are so many fun activities to participate in. The food is amazing also. I have made great memories at Point O' Pines that will last me a lifetime!

I attended this camp for 8 years and then worked there for one summer; my first summer as a camper, I turned 8.  The atmosphere is so supportive and fun, and my experiences there really shaped me into the person I am today.  It's a great place to form good and lasting friendships, pursue interesting activities and try new things in a simply beautiful setting.  The staff is dedicated, diverse, passionate, and fun, and the cabin experience is great fun.  The outdoors-y, minimalistic setting is gorgeous and not as hard to adapt to as a new camper might think; it lends itself to a true learning experience which ends up being quite empowering.  There's a great sense of tradition and community that is easy to become a part of and hold with you in years to come.  I wholeheartedly recommend this camp to any person looking for a great summer experience that they will want to return to again and again.

I went to Kennybrook for seven years, this will be my brother's seventh summer coming up, and my sister is going to Kennybrook for the 1st time this year.  There is a mix of counselors, some are great and others were awful.  Even though when you're 15 you don't really want to play sports we had to play. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. They have redone the canteen, the staff house, the infirmary, the ping-pong plaza, a hockey rink, and the gymnastics pavilon in my seven years so most of the facilities are pretty new and good. The friendships that I made were so worth going even though the food wasn't great.  Most of the kids live in Westchester and Long Island but some are from Florida, New Jersey, and CT. Kennybrook is also a good camp because you know almost everyone's name and everyone is friendly. Also, there are a lot of trips. We went canoeing, white water rafting, to a water park, to Boston, Philidelphia, the West Coast, and Canada.  Overall, Kennybrook is really fun.

I grew up at this camp.   I have made a lot of close friends and will definitly send my unborn children there. The water does taste like sulfer but who cares.  It is so much better than these luxury country club camps that all these little rich kids are going to.  It teaches you about yourself and the world.  The administration were alright but they didn't appreciate my services when I was a counsler (the Best there ever was!!) and I payed attention to all of my campers needs.  In all seriousness this place is unbelievable and you will never have an experience like it ever again!!

It was an absolutely incredible experience and loved every minute of it. I can only look bad with positive memories. Attending this camp may have been the best decision of my life. It has transformed me from a shy young girl into a confident young woman. I crossed paths with people I never would have had the chance to meet and made life long friends. Openmindedness and individuality are celebrated adn one is encouraged to safely try new experiences and explore the world as well as themselves. Those who attend are lucky for such a wonderful opportunity.

I've been going to this camp since i was 8 years old and nothing ever gets old. the staff is what makes me come back every year, they put so much time and effort into everything they do; you can really tell they're there for the kids and not for themselves. Each year i return and there is something new on the campus: new buildings, renovated something, new equipment; it just gets better every time.  Coniston has a wide range of activities from horseback riding to water skiing to arts and crafts to photo and skeet. I really feel like this camp is the best in the country because never once did i feel like an outsider. Every year i get to meet new people and experience something different. This camp is amazing!!!!

If you are seeking a camp that has all the latest bells and whistles...TY is probably not what you are looking for.  However, if you are seeking a camp that will enrich your childs life, provide them with a safe and nurturing environment, and give them friendships that will last a lifetime.... TY is the place for you.  I spent 13 summers at this camp and would not trade the memories for anything.  My kids now go to TY as I'm sure their kids will do in the future.  This is a very special place that is hard to describe to those who have never been there.

At first we were nervous to send our daughter away to sleep away camp. I was happy with the way it seemed that every concern I had already had an answer that put my mind at ease. Not to mention that the camp's facilities blew me and my husband away when we visited last July. It makes me wish I was a camper.

camp is amazing i have been going here for 5 years and i enjoy every minute of it. i have made life long friends here. the owner is really  nice and pays attention to what  most of the campers need. even though there are some  bad counslers camp is overal great. the evening activities are so much fun and the activities really get you going. for all those parents who commented on how bad our camp was becuase of there childrens stories then they don't understand. these paretns have only heard stories and have never gotten to experience it first hand. but it  is your opinion if you want to criticize. i personally love the friends that i made here and the strong relationships i have made here forever.

11 summers; second summer on staff. I am what they call a Kennolyn lifer. I must say that I love it just as much as a counselor as I did as a Camper. I completed the leadership-training program and Kennolyn has provided me with friendships that will last a lifetime. There is such a unique dynamic at this camp. I have strong friendships with people from Mexico, Dubai, France, England, as well as many other countries because of Kennolyn. It was the place that established me with the self- esteem I have today; I can confidently wear my ponytails to the side and sing camp songs at the top of my lungs all year round. It is truly an amazing place. Kennolyn has become my family; I enjoy going back to see the staff that returns on a regular basis, and truly care for the campers, some of the people I work with used to be MY counselors. K- Town is experienced, they know what they are doing. I would definitely recommend it. From a camper to a counselor, its still an amazing place.

Just to clarify a few things:  There are no leetches.  The turtles live way way out deep, where we don't swim.  The snakes (only a few anyway) live on the other side of the lake.  They are all very afraid of people.  In my 8 summers there, no animal has ever bothered a human (at least aquatic animal, there was that weasel who had it out for the 250 lb counselor).  The lake is not dirty and noone has ever gotton lake rash.  We test the water in the lake every couple of days.  It's never failed.  And Romanian counselors disappearing in the middle of the night is the type of thing that makes life more interesting.

This camp is AMAZING!..I went there for 5 years, and i wanted to try something new,so i went to sleepaway camp for 2 years, it could not compare to this camp. For some reason, everyday gets more fun, im so not joking. I just came back last summer and now im going back again for my 7th year!It is safe, fun, and affordable. They have great facilities and counslers. Except for the pools, they could be somewhat cold/dirty, however THATS CAMP!! You just gotta deal with it..The owners are great, they work so hard to make everyone happy. The trips for Teens are great, they make camp fun. I will be starting CIT year this year and i KNOW it will be great.. All of the kids are also really cool,not stuckup, not snobby,not clicky, because i know alot of girls have trouble with that. Kenwal is a great environment and i would most definatly suggest this camp to ANYONE who wants to send their child to camp.

After attending other camps, my children have been at Island Lake for four very happy years.  The counselors are almost all American, which I like because they do not raise their children in other countries like we do.  They also are well-trained and supervise the kids completely.  There is probably no camp in America with the wonderful facilities that this camp has.  The landscaping makes this the lovliest camp I have seen.  There is so much offered to the children that they cannot possibly do everything.  I cannot imagine a child not finding activities that interest them.  The directors are well-liked and are out there with the children.  It seems to me that the few negative comments here are from children who would not be happy at any camp.  My kids live for the summer every year, and I do too, as I am thrilled to see them so happy.  The camp fills early and people who procrastinate do not get their kids in.  I can think of nothing negative about Island Lake.

My all-time favorite thing to do over the summer is go to camp. The feeling when you get there saying that it will be the best summer of your lives is a feeling you almost never get anywhere else. There are going to be a limited number of times in your life when you are as happy as you are at Island Lake. Reuniting with all of your friends & counselors is so much fun. At Camp Island Lake, the fun never stops.

Camp Shalom.  What can I say about it&#63; &#63; It's the best camp in the ENTIRE world!  Once you go there, you won't want to come home.  No Joke.  I know camp should be like your second home.  But Shalom, is pretty much my first home and I would go there anyday.  I enjoyed myself soo much, I don't know what my life would have been like if I didn't go to Shalom.  I loved it!  Whoever hasn't been to Camp Shalom has no idea what in the world they are missing out on.  I love this camp.

I ADORE Camp Scherman!!! I'm was a CIT 1 last summer and I am definitely going back next summer.  Looking back, my first camp experience wasn't that great, but that's because I was with some genuinly annoying campers who fainted and screamed every time they saw a bug until 1 in the morning--it was bad enough that the counselors made us clean the bathroom.  On the plus side, I saw the most beautiful moon and stars that night.  When I plucked up enough courage to give it another try the next summer, I have an amazing time horseback riding and I've gone back every summer that I had time.

The camp shows really well. The owner is a good salesman. The staff teaching many of the activities are not qualified. They don't pay enough. They will not get skilled people. However they do offer a large varity of activities. The owner does put alot of money back into the camp. So the camp does have a few nice new facilities. Cheryl is a very large problem on girls side. She is Lazy & cruel to her staff. When her staff is unhappy it will filter down to the children.  The head of boys side is the opposite. Boys side is one big happy family.

Wow. This is one of the greatest places on our planet. I have known this place for a long time. I was a camper here for a bunch of years, and it was phenomenal. I went from being a shy young boy and developed into an outgoing young man. This was a new heavenly place where a child could step outside the box and make a name for himself. This place taught me everything that I ever needed to know about testing one's limits and chasing one's dreams. This place changed my life. Now, I'm a counselor here, and my passion for the place has grown into a love. This place means the world to me. It has taught me all of the social skills in my life to succeed. I can just be myself. Everyone can. It has given me my best friends in the entire world. Friends as close as family. It is more than a Summer camp. It is a dream. The best dream a child could ever wish for, and it lasts all Summer. This place has touched me. I will never love a place in our world as much as I love camp Coniston. Wow.

Trails End is such an amazing place where you go to form undeniable friendships and grow as a person. Trails end is absolutely gorgeous, but it is really the people that make it what it is. This will be my fourth summer, and i am so proud to be apart of something so unbelievably incredible. Next year i will be a trinity, the leaders of campus, and i know that i can step up to the challange because of the amazing staff. Camp is the only place i feel complete at. I made 13 friends in my bunk, and we are so close that i call them my sisters. Camp has given me friendships that I know will last a lifetime and taught me charachter and how to be a person i can be proud of. Trails end will always be a part of me.

The kids were awful the one year I went there. Japs, jerks, and snobs is what I would like to call it. The facilities are very nice, and if your kid has that popularity ego to them then they'll like it. But for a new kid trying to make new friends, don't go to Tyler hill. The staff doesn't help out much either for the kids who aren't popular.

My daughter has been to other camps in Ohio, Minnesota and California and simply loved Scherman. Scherman was spectaular because most of the staff have many, many years of experience at this camp - both as campers and as counselors - so really understand and appreciate the campers, they know the programs, are familiar with the safety regulations and they clearly enjoy being with each other too.  My daughter particularly liked the horse program and the physical beauty of the camp (it's huge!).  One of the best things about Scherman is that this is a camp that SINGS!

Both of my children attended Frost Valley for 5 summers each and truly loved it.  It does not offer a lot of bells & whistles, but a gorgeous location on a former estate in the Catskills.  Things that are emphasized include environmental issues, sustainability, and of course, bonding with your fellow campers.  Campers generally come from the tri-state area (CT, NJ, NY) but counselors hail from across the US, as well as several countries abroad.  Our family thinks it's just terrific, except for the food, which needs some work.

Amazing Camp.  The people are awesome.  I love Pontiac, have been here for many years, the kids are great and it's and all around good atmosphere.  The Management is incredible.  The Staff is Hot.  The Sports Specialists this year were better than ever.  Reading some of the last comments and they were written by some pretty ignorant people...that's not suprising as their are some pretty ignorant parents here...that's what you get when you have a multimillion dollar trophy wife sittin at home with nothing to do but flick her bean.  Hope we have another good summer next year.  This one's been the best yet, and with the new facilities flying up around here the next summer should be even better.  Facilities go up faster at Pontiac than any other camp in the nation.

Camp Marston is a fabulous summer camp with great ammenities where the kids are exposed to a whole range of great activities and experiences in an environment in which they are supported and respected.  Attendees are exposed to campers, counsellors and staff of many nationalities, bringing them together in an environment which encourages acceptance and tolerance with self and others through wonderful social and cultural experiences.  Such a wonderfull experience myself and many other's i met at Camp Marston, returned as counsellors for additional summers of fun and learning!  Highly recommended from Down Under.

This coming summer will be my third and last summer at chimney as a camper. Looking back on my two years before it the first thing that i think to myself is i wish i had come earlier! CCC is the best camp experience you can ask for. And though i am stopping my experience as a camper i plan to go on ICEP be and AIDE and a counsler in the years to come. The staff at CCC is amazing and really cares about the camp and campers. They do enjoy their jobs, and you can realy tell! All the campers are very kind and always include new campers during there frist summer. I have had the best 2 summers of my life at CCC and have made the closest friends who are now more like my sisters. I would totaly recomend this camp to any girl who is looking for a traditional, fun, all around amazing summer experience full of friendships and memories that you will never forget!  CCC has a beautiful location and tons of amazing activities to chose from. No matter what you like, there is something for you there!

I have twin 5 year-old boys.I made a big mistake of separating them this summer.I sent one child to Crestwood and the other to another popular camp in the area.What a difference between the 2 camps!!  At Crestwood the staff was older,more mature and seemed genuinely happy to be working with children.At the other camp,I found the couselors sitting and socializing alot.At Crestwood my son moved 3 swim levels,and at the other camp, despite private instruction, only moved 1 level.My son at Crestwood loved the athletic instructor Jim.I understand that he was a professional basketball player.As a birthday present I need to buy a basketball backboard for my son, and he played in the soccer league for the first time in the fall.I never expected the communication that I got from Crestwood-all the phone calls,e-mails and progress reports.The nurses were terrific making sure that he got his asthma meds on schedule.Food was great!!Next summer both boys will go to Crestwood which is worth every $.

I look back on ENC and only have fond memories. I think i lost about 10 pounds while i was there. It's a great way to get your kids healthy and in tune with nature. By far the most creative and unique summer camp in the south! I can't express how much this camp meant to me and hopefully kids in the future will be able to have the same experiences!

Tanamakoon, yes, its a great time and i have been going there now since a long time.... It is expensive yes but what you get is a lot greater. You get to learn more people, you get to be more like yourself or just freak out. Nobody cares what you wear, you could go to dinner just wearing spendex, but thats not my point. Its is a camp where a girl learns to be responsible and gets to know amazing people, it doesnt matter if you come new to the camp or not, you find friends anyway. Just think about it, the girls are there to have fun... (so are you!) and please think about why sooooo many girl keep returning to camp... They just love it!... See you this years gurlz!

This camp is the BEST EVER! AS a MAP i have been going to Kenwood for a while and can't get enough. If you don't like chicken, pasta, salad, tacos, ribs, meatloaf and more-then you need to read adjust your diet. They DON'T only serve chicken and pasta and if you don't like the meal the chefs will make you whatever you want. The staff is incredibly helpful and if there is a problem they will fix it immediatly.  The facilities and activites are amzing! Yeah- there are cliques-of your WHOLE age group! Everyone there is friendly and accepting of new campers! There are NO favorites from the owners. You barely even see them, how can they treat you like dirt&#63;&#63;&#63;!&#63; It is true as you get older you have moe fun but that is because you have more responsibility just like at home and school. Therefore the law lets you go out bowling or to a movie. Some other comments say that it's not worth your moey-LIES! It seems like every cent is spent towards making our time more enjoyable! I&lt;3KENWOOD MAPS '07!

This was by far the best summer experience a boy could have!  I don't think the guy who put that the staff wasn't attentive knew what he was talking about....the ratio of 8 kids for 2 counselors speaks for itself.  Most public camps - like YMCA camps have less staff per cabin.I think the fact that so many kids return and staff returns also speaks for what a good experience this is!  So many boys' Dads also attended. If it wasn't great you wouldn't send your son.  Also, most counselors were campers at one point.  Yes it is competitive sportswise but, hey, that's sports!!!!  Most kids really improve in athletics over the summer instead of sitting around on the computer or watching TV. GO TO RAC!

you should also mention that a camp that revolves around a board of directors rather than the campers, is not a camp.  neither is a camp that has a horrible retention rate and lowsy management.  at least the good thing about campers only going for one month, or two separate months, is that there are two maccabiahs,  but that is really the only good thing.

Too many kids!  They don't know your child at all.  I've gotten a call from the nurse about a child who wasn't even my son.  The mixup wasn't cleared up for an hour! That shouldn't happen, especially at a camp that charges what they do.  Unfortunately all the camps this size in this region seem to be this way. Pack in the kids, pay the counselors nothing and make MONEY

I'm an adult - I've been to Scherman with my troop, for training, mom-and-me camp, and 2 summer sessions as a counselor and it is my FAVORITE place in the world!  The air is clear, you can see millions of stars, and there's a ton to do.  Yes, there's a lot fo walking, it's hot in the summer, and the counselors are mean about making sure everyone drinks water, wears sunscreen and hats, and contributes to the camp society by doing kapers.  I can honestly say I am a better person for having been a counselor and learned from the younger staff and the campers as well.  I wish I had a camp like this to attend when I was a girl!!

Tan most defenitely played the largets role in my growing up! Tan isn't so much about the cabins or activities...it's much more about the poeple you meet, the friends that you make, the leaders you want to become! Couple all that with great food and an amazing staff and you will be in for the time of your life! Don't get me wrong....it's not all pure happiness....some of the times are about growing up and that can hurt. But wow...what a supportive place to be in when you have to do it! It is the top of my list of life time experiences for sure!

My daughter LOVES this camp.  We have gone for 2 years and this year she came home with something different inside her.  It all finally clicked and in the process she has clicked off the TV.  This is a wonderful healthy environment that takes kids back to the basics and teaches them what is important. God, family, yourself.  It allows them to commune with nature and with God and their peers who have the same committment to the Sole Creator.  I hate that we only have a few years left to go.  At first the price seemed a little steep but then can you really put a price on your child's soul&#63;  Expect us again next year, this time for the 2 week sessions and the year after that, and the year after that, etc.  Praise God you are here.  A very happy parent

yes, the camp is exremly jappy. however, that is true at ANY sleepaway camp, especially jewish sleepaway camps,  i am a jew. i spent the last four augusts of my life at kenwood and i wouldnt have it any other way. the owener, sharon&#63; yeah, she doesnt know anyone but she is pleasant and it doesnt matter, she doesnt play a huge impact on our lives at camp.as part of maps 07, i had the best summer of my life. the friendships i made there are everlasting and the acquaintances will help me later in life. kenwood triggers amazing memories, jokes, summers and friends in my mind. my counselors were amazing and the bunks are carefully organized and fit perfectly. kenwood is the home of so much.the four year shirt hardly does any justice in recounting my summers there. The staff who are there want to be there. i found it to be amazaign and for those of you who didnt, please dont tarnish the camp in the aumni's memores. to meet,to know, to love, to part, is always the fate of a campers heart.

Bellaleo will always remain close to my heart, as it has been a huge part of my life for 10 years. Being a leader at Bellaleo has helped me grow tremendously. I continue to learn more about myself over one summer than I do through out the remaining ten months back home. I couldn’t be more grateful to have such a rewarding job.

Forest Acres is a wonderful place for children and adults to learn and grow. Over the years I feel it has given me far more than I can ever give in return. The friendships I made at FA have had far more influence on my life than those made elsewhere. I met my wife at camp, we were married in Fryeburg by a friend we met at FA. For the sporty child its a slamdunk, for the twirly, its a great place to get a groove on, and for the musician, like me, it is nothing short of inspirational. I am forunate enough to live only a drive away from Fryeburg. I often visit in the winter just to see if the campfire is still flickering, or to listen to the tall pines as they echo the children's voices singing in Tip Top. If you do send your children here for a summer, arm them only with a smile and a desire to be a part of something special....the rest will just happen.  Pinky.

Camp Greenville is absolutely amazing. Ever since I first went to camp, I make sure that I have time during the summer to attend. At first I didn't want to go, but when I got to the camp and saw it while dropping of my younger sibilings in June, I decided to attend the camp in July. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made.  It's such an awesome place where you meet so many new people, get so many new experiences, and learn new things every day. I would, and have, reccommend this camp to anyone wishing for an amazing experience.

Other than their food, I'm really surprised that this camp still has anything to do with the OCA.  They only meet the minimum requirements and make no effort to go above and beyond and they've broken the OCA's ethics several times after being reminded about it.  Hopefully the next time the OCA needs to visit the camp for their 4-year check up, which I believe could be next year, they'll step in and make the necessary adjustments.

Chimney Corners has changed my life. It has made me a mature, independent, responsible, and loving young woman. I wouldn't trade the experiences I've had here for the world. There is truly nowhere else on Earth like this little peace of heaven in the Berkshires. I will be returning for my eighth summer as an assistant counselor. I met my best friends (my sisters)at Chimney and they taught me that people will love me for who I am. Words can not express what CCC has done for me. I truly reccommend it (and Becket) to anyone!

Camp becket is simply the best and most beautiful place you could ever want to spend your summer. I just finished my sixth summer as a camper and had the best time of my life. Any time I have the privelege to spend at Becket is just so cherishable and it just might be my favorite place in the world. Just the thoughts of waking up to the cool mountain air, spending thime with friends and counselors, and closing out the day with cabin chat make me long camp all throught the year. It is truly the best camp in America!

I started my camping experience at west hills at the age of 5.  I went through all the age groups and into junior and teen travel.  I then became a counselor and was at the camp for an overall of 15 years. It is a wonderful place.  As a counselor I was able to work with many great people as well as having many great campers that I still see day to day.  Its always a great feeling to see campers that still remember you after a few years of having them in your group, because the head staff of the camp really doesn't have any interest in getting to know their staff members below them. But other then that, I think the supervision is great! as far as competition goes, I think that would be more for the boys, and as staff we are taught to eliminate that feeling of competition and we are taught how to in the orientations before camp starts.  I think people need to realize how amazing this camp is and how many great memories your kids will have.

When I was younger I looked at many camps.  I was a mommy's girl so camp was not exactly on my to do list. After seeing FA I told my mom if I ever went to camp I would deffinatly go there. It was an instant connection.  Well I was a smart girl and made the right choice.  Going to camp was the best decision I have ever made.  Forest Acres is amazing.  The facilities are beautiful, with great activities; they literally have everything. I have made my best friends there and the counsilors have always been there as mentors and friends.  I cant imagine my life without FA. I cant wait to be back at my home away from home. Log One 2007!

My son had an amazing counselor from Texas this past year, who he had seen last year and knew that he wanted him as his counselor this year. As soon as I saw my son again he told me this had been his best year at Ridgecrest yet. The counselor really took him and the other boys in and made sure they had fun, all I hear is about cabin toga dance parties, and going out to a field to star at the most amazing stars he had ever seen! The counselors in my boys tribe really went out of their way to make sure their boys felt loved. But more importantly my son grew spiritually. The difference in him is amazing. Thanks Camp Ridgecrest! and thanks Counselor Josh from Texas! I would recommend this camp to anyone!

Tanamakoon is a place that has changed my life. It truly is my summer home, my favorite place on earth! The people you will meet will change your life, the friendships will fill your brain with amazing memories. No words in teh word could describe the time you spend at Tanamakoon, wether your there for 2 days or 2 months the time spent is priceless. When your lying in bed just after singing taps, you look back on the day that you have just had. Filled with laughs, friends, games and a beautiful atmosphere. You see the love in the eyes of each camper everyday you there, the pure joy that comes from each one. Nothing is sadder then leaving day, when campers and counselor must say goodbye to there summer friends. Tanamakoon will forever be in my heart, camp life is one much mroe glorious then normal life. Love and friendship are a huge aspect, your never a lone at Tanamakoon, never lonely or unloved. If your thinking about sending your daighter to Tanamakoon, do it. IT IS LIFE CHANGING!!!

Summer 2006 was my son's first year at Ridgecrest and second year at a summer camp.  Ridgecrest exceeded my expectations.  We are both very protective of our only child and felt extremely comfortable leaving him at camp.  The staff was wonderful - caring - understanding - compasionate and most inportant - they were fun.  We registered for the 2007 session as soon as it was available. Our son checked their website EVERY day and let us know when registration was open.  His desire to go back told us we made the right choice when we chose Ridgecrest.

This camp costs a lot of money considering they dont have anything more than the next camp(so many in the area).  The staff is lazy(not all, but most) and this is the most unflexible camp in the area.   Anything you ask for... the answer is usually a NO.    Its more about their convenience than the convenience of the parents(the ones paying the huge bill).

BHEC is the most amazing camp on earth. I went to BHEC for 7 summers, made lifelong friends that i will never forget. The counslers made a lifetime impression on me and helped me grow to be the person i am today. The grounds are beautiful, the people are amazing, and the new facilities are amazing. at age 9 i was supposed to go for one month, and when my mother came to visit half way through the summer i ran up to her not to say hello, but to ask if i could stay the whole summer. There was never a summer i did not stay 2 months and for the 10 months i was there all i wanted to do was go back. And at 23, my only regret is that i am not still there!!!!!

Quite honestly, this camp is great. Obviously in a program that allows your child to pick his/her own activities there will be some kids that will sit around all day. This seems to be a common complaint on this website. However, I know for a fact that if you want your child to do certain activites, the parent can specify this. As a camper going back for my eighth year I can honestly say that the camp is incredible. Obviously the owners care about the parents, campers, staff, and facility because if they didn't, they wouldn't be running a camp in the first place. There are plenty of other ways to make money. In addition, Dave Landers has improved the food tremendously and it is a lot better then other camps. These bad reviews give an inaccurate impression of Island Lake. If the camp was so bad then why do so many kids return each year&#63;

My children did NOT attend this year but will be attending next year.  I should have went by my first instinct when shown around by wonderful, caring and sincere people.  Instead I followed my crowd to a camp where noone knows me or who my child is(because they have too many campers to ever possibly know them all).  There should be a limit as to how many campers a camp accepts. Kenwal does that.  They do not go overboard.

I have spent six years at Red Arrow as both a camper and a counselor.  No where else in my life have I found a place that teaches a person (young and old)the value of teamwork.  At RAC I learned that I can accomplish so much more with the help friends and family.  But the most important lesson that I have learned is that I am a person that people can count on to make the right decisions.

Blue Lake was a great expirence, i grew as a dancer and as a person!!!! all of the staff was very friendly!! the food was less than great though, but who goes to camp for the food right!!! everyday they had wonderful activites!! the dance was very exciting!! i hope that i can attend this camp once again next year!! and i think that it is fantastic that this camp is a place where youth can express who they are and all of there tallents!! this is also a great place for making new friens!! two weeks of sharing the same cabin with a group of people can really be a memorable expirience! it thank BLue Lake for introducing me to a spontanious group of girls we all are attending next year, in the same cabin if possible!!!

Many parents send their children away for a summer with the intent of 3-9 weeks for parenting vacation. Well, I assure you FWF is the best place to send any child interested in expanding their minds, honing their talents, creating, but most importantly; becoming a more confident, self-aware individual...and being surrounded by the most supportive and loving fellow campers and staff. As a former French Woods camper, I can comofortably state that FWF has shaped me into a person I am proud of, a more open-minded individual. There, I learned to grow as a performer; learning all of the aspects of theater, involving myself with their superior Orchestra, flying on the trapeeze...and meeting the most amazing people I would never have met otherwise. I love this place, and I bet your children would too, I urge any parent looking for an arts camp to look no further, at FWF there is a place for every child &lt;33 Thank you Ron, for giving me the best summers of my life!

Point O' Pines is the best camp you can send your daughter to. The bueaty is spectacular, the activities are great and the people you meet are truly incredible. I was shocked to see some of the bad ratings on this page, but lets face it, sleep-away camp is not for everyone. If u went to POP and didnt like it you are obviusly not a camper. This camp is unlike any other. I would know this having attended an other sleep-away camp for two summers. I didn't enjoy my expirence and was about to give up on camping until i went to the Point.  Something about this place is just so special. I will never again be able to spend time at a place so filled with so much love and support. The friends I have made here are unlike any others. We share a bond that will last our whole lives through. I feel that developing such rare and unique friendships is the true purpose of going to camp.The point has shaped me into the person i am today.If you dont like this camp,u will not like any others. --DG Peak '06

I'm glad that some people are finally exposing publicly what's been going on.  Last year, we finally had a good combination with Bob and April and some pretty good unit heads - but then Malka had to step in AGAIN and screw it up.  Really, the idiot is the guy in Toronto who keeps hiring Malka - YOssi Winter.  As for 'Monetary Value', what a joke.  I'd pay it if my kids would have fun, but it was terrible this summer, just when things were looking up.

I have never been to a better place in the world. and i don't think i ever will. Coniston is what you make it. If you go to camp thinking you will have a bad time then you will. I have been going to Coniston since i was 9 and it's been the best 6 summers of my life. School is boring and you have to do work. Coniston is the place you go to spend your summer away from your family and school. Coniston becomes your home. The friends I've made at camp are THE best i will ever have. We all get together and hang out all the time because hanging out with camp friends is 100 times more fun then hanging out with friends from school. I love my friends from school but they just don't compare. Some people say the food is bad or the cabins are dirty but it doesn't matter. It's the experience that counts. Coniston is amazing. Everything about it. At least once a week I have a day where I can't stop thinking about camp. If I could live there year-round I would. It IS the best place on earth.

My son (13) had an excellent experience at Camp Seymour.  He going back and his younger sister is joining him this year.  My son is reserved and shy and both his councelors respected his nature. Location is beautiful, facilities are in great condition (4 rating reflects a bathroom mess left by pranksters), superb value.  We travel to CS from central Idaho after our research of the entire region showed us this was the best place for our family.  Professional, caring staff.

fwf is my seconh home.  this year was my 4th year and i honestly never wanted to leave.  i cried for days after i left.  i met so many amazing people.  at this camp, everyone is accepted for who they are, and no one makes anyone change.  the theatre program is great, and there are a million amazing shows that go on.  there are sports, too.  even though this is a performing arts camp, i had friends who didn't do anything at camp that had to do with theater.  there is no pressure.  everyone there supports each other.  the food is great.  the staff is funny and nice.  the facilities are clean.  Frenchwoods is definitly my favorite place in the world.  i couldn't imagine my life without it.  i recommend this camp 100%.

ILC is one of the best places I've ever been in my live.  It is my home away from home.  If you have not been at this camp yet, you have never been at a camp before.  It is a magical place where I found true identity by spending time having fun.  I met some of my best friends there and are going back every year just so that ILC and bring us all together again.  This is not just any camp it is the best camp ever can give you a change to be all you can be by letting you do what you want to do for the day.  I will always go back to camp even if it's just in the wonderful memories it gave me

As the mother of a first year camper at Chimney Corners, I have only the greatest things to say about this camp. It is well organized, the counselors are very well trained, and my daughter, who is 13, adjusted beautifully. New campers and returning campers blended very well. There was also a strong emphasis on values.  I was so pleased and my daughter can't wait to return next summer. She is hoping to become an aide and a counselor herself in a few years.

Our son was put in a cabin where everyone his age left half way through the summer. Then, when the staff should have recognized that he was having a tough time socially, he was essentially ignored. The facilities are average for the price. It is a good thing that they are making the lake better.  The senior leadership seem very nice but I am not thrilled with the counselor to camper ratio in the cabins or the quality of the general counselors.  The good thing for my son is that he does love the activities of camp and therefore had an OK time, but we will be looking for another place next summer.

althought the camp is beatufiul   the groups are way too big   noone knows who anyone is there... staff, kids, etc...   it looks like a country club but there are SO many kids there   there is not enough time at the activities to enjoy them.    PRETTY and UNFRIENDLY and VERY COMPETITIVE(amongst kids)  which hurts kids self esteem.

I have been a staff member at Coniston for many years now, I have gained life long friendships, ones that I will cherish to the end. I never got the chance to go to Consiton as a kid, but I hope that someday I will be able to send my Children, because I know that they will become better people for it, they will meet children from all walks of life,and it is these children that they will be friends with forever. The staff are truly wonderful, genuine caring people, its wonderful to see them interacting with the campers and it is so clear to se that the children are the reason they are there! The 400+ campers are all wonderful and unique in their own special way, they bring many different traits to camp which is why it makes it so special. Campers and staff can be individuals, its a place where differences arent seen or met. Coniston is one, the staff and campers are one they are all esquisite in their own way. What more is there to say-Coniston is a truly special place!

Camp is really fun. Some of the negative posts (which all happened around the same date) are pretty funny- but not true. Camp is good for it's characters. I am planning to work there again this summer because I had a great time, I was looked after well and I really enjoyed being a counselor for my bunk of campers. See you in '07. Oh and the thing about the food is that there are tons of choices- even for the pickiest eater. The camp made special menus for kids that had strange food allergies and everything. If you don't like chicken, then eat something else. At least at this camp you have a choice- unlike other camps that I worked at.

omfg fwf is my freaking life! i go back every summer because i love it that much. it's freaking amazing. they have so many things to do. you can try things there that you never thought you would ever be able to do. they encourage you to beleive in yourself and try new things. it's so awesome. and everyone is so accepting of who you are. no one judges you and you just have the time of your life. i would definitely reccomend french woods to ANYONE because they have EVERYTHING there. i would especially recommend it to theater people though because the theater program there is phenomenal and everything is extremely professional. circus is my life. before i went to french woods, i never would have thought that i would be on a flying trapeze, or twirling fire around or any of the zillions of other awesome things they offer. the staff is so helpful and everything is just great. the bunks are really nice and you meet so many new people there who will become friends you will have for a lifetime

I think the fact that Surprise Lake, of all the camps listed here, has the most people who rated it is a testament to how much we all love it.  It's not perfect, because no place in this world can be.  It's eccentricities, it's rustic nature, it's caring focus on working out the problems that inevitibly do arise, are the things that make it a haven for so many of us.

Camp Kennybrook is wonderful.  My 2 kids are returning to camp for their 5th year and my oldest son went to Camp Kennybrook for 7 years.  It was the best experience for them.  They made new friends and they kept in touch and managed to see each other during the winter. My kids learned to play sports, my son learned how to swim better. Camp Kennybrook is definately their 2nd home and family.  The Landsman family are very warm and caring people.  They run a great camp.

SLC is a great summer camp.  It's been around for 100+ years and almost all the kids come back every year.

That last person was my daughter.  She went to Taconic last summer as her 1st sleepaway camp experience and had a terrible time! She was horribly homesick and it was not dealt with well. She had 2 terrible counselors. Both were new to camping, neither had ever been a camper or counselor anywhere before.  They implemented inappropriate rules that made my daughter even more homesick.  They insisted that the girls drink 2 cups of water at every meal before they could have anything else to drink. They insisted that the girls have a serving of vegtables before they could have seconds of the main meal. While we all want our children to eat healthy, this was not the forum! Even when Jill, the owner/director knew there were issues, the counselors were not switched out. Additionally, Jill is a one man show, which makes her spread way too thin. Lastly, the facilities are great but often the kids aren't able to use them, i.e. no one on duty at the lake when they had waterfront.

I have never had a problem with this camp, it really is different from others.  They know your child for one, and everything about them.  It has a great family feeling, go on a tour you will feel it. They also limit there camp to only 300 campers to, which is great for my son.  I love that there is so many different activities also, no matter what they always have something new for him to do. The staff are great and reallt make the summer for him also.

My son is not the kind of kid who will win a camper of the year award. Preferring bugs and art to sports I was very concerned. Kenwal staff made him feel comfortable and he had a fantastic summer. He always had choices of great activities to do and ended the summer with a love of baseball.  While he lost some underwear and socks, he never had a bad day and woke up every morning eager to go to camp.  That's what it's all about.  Other local camps may offer more (over the top in my opinion) but Kenwal has the personality of a camp that lets kids feel comfortable, is non-competitive, and when a parent calls up, the directors know your child.  Kenwal is real. It's not about who has the biggest bankroll or fanciest clothes. It's a fantastic camp where kids come home dirty, tired and happy. I am thankful for the wonderful summer Kenwal has provided my son and we look forward to this year and many more.

I don't even know if words express how great Frost Valley is.  Let me just say this, I was 9 years old when I first went to FV and I've done three of the different camps, including farm camp!  Since I've started, I have always had an amazing time at FV and I can't stay away.  Frost Valley literally carried me through an awkward stage of my life and I turned out to be a better person because of FV.  Without it, I know I wouldn't be the person I am today.  I have just completed my first summer and I was absolutely blown away!  Seeing FV through the other side(the staff side) was an experience I am so grateful to have gone through.  There wasn't a day at camp I didn't see a kid absolutely happy and believe me, it's one of the most beautiful things anyone can see in their life.  I've recommended many families to FV and they have all had positive feedback.  I would highly recommend FV to anyone.  Thank you FV for the experience you have given me, I am a better person because of it.

Very pretty camp but wayyyy too many kids. My kids went for 4 years and the swimming program is terrible.  I guess with hundreds of kid in the same pool its very hard to teach anyone to actually swim. The woman who answers the phone is the most obnoxious nasty one there. If you call, immediately ask to speak to someone else who can better deal with taking a phone call.  Counselors are all nice kids though and kids do have fun.  Air conditioned buses are a plus.

I absolutely love this camp. It is my second home. This coming summer will be my 9th summer and I'll be a CIT. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. In response to other comments, the bunks are only filty if your kids don't clean like they are supposed to. Supervision is absolutely not a problem, especially for the younger kids. For those children there are 3 counselors a bunk plus maybe a CIT, they have a curfew early enough, and they have counselors at activities that watch them. Granted they aren't watched every time they move, but if you wanted that then why consider sleepaway in the first place&#63; Watch them yourself. Counselors care if you go to activites or not, the kids are called over the loudspeaker and looked for. Craig won't have a problem with you signing up for the same thing every day, unless you say that you don't want your child doing that. Don't diss this camp. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Island Lake, I love you! RIP: Poppy, Dwight,and D. &lt;3

I love this camp!!!  I have made friends with different groups of people, and many friendships that i know will last forever!  It's cool because i made friends from all different states and countries.  They have weekly meetings to make sure that the camp keeps up its good reputation, and to make sure the counselors are always looking out for the campers.  For the people who said that there is no supervision and you could just leave camp, you are completely wrong.  If anything, they are over protective and worried.  I know someone who left camp and they got kicked out.  If anything that punishment was too harsh, but they clearly care.  On the last night of the sessions they pay counselors extra to make sure campers aren't sneaking out of their bunks and swimming in the lake, etc.  There are different groups of people, so it's easy for anyone to make friends.  The only downside is that there are sessions.  There is also a newly added trip third session that was great I LOVE ISLAND LAKE!!

This is a goody two shoes camp. Everything is good good good. So of course i have to give it all 5s. But id much rather go to a camp where you dont get suspended for going into female cabins. Seriously why on earth would i not wanna go into female cabins im a guy, but its not like id do anything you know. I just wanna talk to girls cant they let us do even tht. And at this camp everything is way way too perfect. The facilities are great; we have a miniput place for gads sake!! And if you seem the least bit unhappy the supercheery staff will try to make you feel better: Whats wrong&#63; Do you want to go inside&#63; Wanna do something&#63; DO SOMETHING&#63;&#63;&#63;!!! HOW MANY THINGS WILL I DO WITH A COUNSELER&#63;&#63;!!!!!

THE FRIENDSHIPS I HAVE MADE HERE ARE SO SPECIAL AND DIFFERENT THAN ANYWHERE ELSE- YOU ARE COMPLETELY YOURSELF. YOU DON'T PRETEND TO BE ANYONE, AND CAN DO ANYTHIGN YOU WANT HERE. HONESTLY, I HAVE 29 PEOPLE I CAN CALL MY SISTERS. WHERE ELSE DO YOU GET THAT- NOWHERE. THERE IS NOTHING LIKE POINT O' PINES. THE FOOD IS AMAAZING! AND THE BUNKS ARE SO INCREDIBLY NICE. I ACTUALLY THINK HTIS IS THE NICEST CAMP THAT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO, AND I WOULD SEND MY DAUGHTER HERE IN A HEARTBEAT. DON'T LOOK AT THE RATINGS ON THIS WEBSITE, TALK TO REAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THERE AND LOVED IT. ALL SLEEPAWAY CAMPS ARE 'JAPPY' TO AN EXTENT, BUT THATS BECAUSE ITS SLEEPAWAY CAMP. ITS NOT THIS CAMP IN PARTICULAR. POINT O PINES IS EVERY GIRLS DREAM. ITS A PART OF ME, AND ALW

This will be my 6th year at Chimney Corners, and I can't imagine a summer without it.  The camp is beautiful, and the people i met there will be my friends for the rest of my life.  Going there is a truly amazing experience.

I went to this camp for 8 years as a camper and last year I was a TLC (counsellor in training). All I can say is please, please come and try this camp out. It is an amazing experience. It can and will change your life. You will make the best friends ever and have the best times of your life. It's different then any other camp...it's hard to explain. Just go try it out yourself! Trust me! You won't regret it!                   TAHOE SR

Unless you've been going to camp here since you were 6to be shunned by the snotty girls here.  they are cliquey, obnoxious, and spoiled. And the counselors are just older versions of the campers.

I simply cannot imagine my life without YCG. This past summer was my 7th year, and every day I have to mark on my calender that it's one less day until I go back. I'll finally be a counselor next year and I absolutely cannot wait to help give kids the same amazing experience that I was given. YCG has granted me opportunities that most people couldn't imagine in their wildest dreams. I was exposed to my first true love, rock climbing, and also to other adventurous excursions like mountain biking, backpacking, caving, and white water rafting. More importantly though, camp introduced me to some of my best friends that will last lifetimes and inspired me to want to become a better person.

This place is home to me. I've been going to Coniston since 1998 and have gone from camper to staff member. Its a place that you become hooked onto and cannot find it in yourself to leave. This place will give you or your children a life time of warm memories and friendships. My mother always tells me how thankful she is for sending me to Coniston. Its the best thing she could have done for me and my future. I thank her, and your children will thank you.

As a previous multi-year staff member I feel that Trail's End is a strong camp that highly values the safety of the children there.  Seems to be losing some of the family feel with the change in leadership from Stan to Marc, it seems to have more of a focus on being a business than a camp family now than before.

THE BEST CAMP EVER! My dad and aunt went their for there whole life. My mom is a nurse, she loves it. My sister is the youngest girl there, so everybody on girls side knows her. My dad plays the piano for the whole camp on Fridays. I just LOVE IT. IT IS THE BEST CAMP EVER! If u don't like it u must have never been there, because it's beautiful. The campers get so caught up with color war & olympics that it's not even funny. So much camp spirit. Especially in the Lazurus Bowl. GO THC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(: &lt;:

this camp is amazing. when i first went, i didnt know anyone. in a matter of hours the girls in my cabin became my family. frost valley is such a magical place where you can be yourself regardless of who you are during the school year. no one judges you and everyone accepts everyone for who they are. i miss not seeing my friends that ive made over the years. not being able to see everyone as a unit is hard. there are many things that make me think of the summers there. andwhen i think of them, i cant help but smile.

Formerly under the name of The Cove Camp, this facility has been visited by thousands of campers and I am proud to say that I am one of them.  The staff is taken throught a complete interview and hiring process to ensure the best are hired.  There is never a dull moment during the week.  If you are looking for a great camp, this is it!

Forest Acres is the best camp I have ever been to.  This is my summer home and has been for 5 years.  My best friends in the world are all from camp.  The staff is the best.  They are my friends and my mentors. I love to ride and play tennis and both these activities are fantastic.  I also love trip days every Wednesday.  FA is truely the greatest place  I can ever imagine to spend a summer.

sleeping bag: $68... 18 trunk: $100... Kennolyn tuiton: $1,200... giving your kid the time of their life: priceless.  There are some things money can't buy...and you'll find them all at Kennolyn.                               I love Kennolyn so much.  When I was younger, I would start a Kennolyn countdown the week after I got back, and I drove my parents crazy constantly talking about it.

My daughter and I have been to Camp Scherman five times over the last three years. We have gone as a troop, a mother-daughter team, and she as a summer camper. I have volunteered as a sessional nurse as well. We both love the camp. The staff is amazing and warm and always makes if fun for the girls. The camp is beautiful and at 5500 feet, has the blackest sky and is great for seeing lots of shooting stars at night. We have been there in the snow in Feb. and the very hot days of summer. It gets really hot and dry and requires vigilence to water consumption and sunscreen which the staff constantly reinforces to the girls. We always come away from camp relaxed and rejuvinated. The girl scout spirit is alive and well at Scherman.

When I was a camper at this camp, the councelors NEVER paid any attention to me. I did a 3 week session. In those three weeks, I had my towel stolen while I took a shower, got hit with a ping pong table from which I still have a mark (it has been many years), and I spent about a week in the infirmary for a severe sunburn that the nurse told me to use aloe on to make it feel better. The bunks were not too bad, but the staff pays virtually no attention to the campers as they were often hid away in their own rooms. The food was not that good. The water that comes out of the fountains tastes like sulfur. They do have good rainy day activities. I guess you get your money's worth because the camp isn't all that expensive. The administrators at the camp are all VERY nice. Hopefully, since I was last at the camp, these things have improved.

For the past 5 years, Trails End has changed me as a person and a friend...  i cannot say enough about my second home, but that it wraps your heart up and never lets go.  I have a quite difficult decision this summer of returning to the place I love, or working towards bettering my college chances.  I have been in Varsity for two years now and if i go back this coming 2007 summer, i will be a Leadership Trainee, or LT.  Both my uncles, my father and my fathers aunt went to TEC and now my brother and I both do.  We both agree, we dont know where we would be without Trails End in our lives, i recommend it to all.  The staff is incredible, the memories are everlasting, and the friendships made are golden.  I love you trails end. &lt;3 I.M.

Crestwood tries hard to accommodate everyone and therefore the activities are great but the groups are too large!  The kids only get the good activities once every other week (or 4 times) a whole summer which is why so many kids leave for sleepaway as soon as they are old enough!  Crestwood would be smart to limit # of kids and group sizes and everyone would be happier.

TO me  this camp is very underated.. It has ALL the same activities that ALL the EXCLUSIVE(COUNTRY CLUB LIKE ) camps have... and THEN SOME...    Much less kids  so they can actually use all the activities for a nice amount of time and enjoy them  and this is a place where EVERYONE knows EVERYONE ... from campers, to parents. to staff, to owners..  THIS IS ONE BIG FAMILY  unlike all the other oversized, overcrowded camps.

Quite possibly the best camp in the USA and by far the best camp in New England! Proud to be a staff member and a former camper.

My mom went to this camp for years and stayed the whole summer every year, and I also went a few years and was a counselor for 3. This is the most incredible place! Every year I leave camp I am even more confident than the year before. Kennolyn is a place where I have always felt I can be my true self. Counselors and campers come from all over the world, year after year, to spend their summers there. Kennolyn will always hold a very special place in my heart, as I know it does for countless others.

The kids are TERRIBLE.  One girl i barely knew came up to me and sprayed my eyes with bugspray, thinking she was funny.

You will find a bunch of kind-hearted peers, but many of the girls are catty.

I was a participant in one of the icep trips.  It was absolutly terrible.  I highly discourage / encourage parents and campers to really sift through the information the camp sends out and evaluate if it will be the right fit for them.  If you are interested in over protective, non realistic cultural experiences, then maybe icep is for you, however, if you want to actually see what it is like in the respective country, think again...

I was eight when I first went to Bellaleo. I remember being so nervous about being away from home. However, Bellaleo was an amazing camp and I begged my mom to go back every year. I spent 15 years at Bellaleo, and they are some of the best memories of my life. It's a smaller camp and I met life long friends. I would highly recommend Camp Bellaleo and hope one day to be able to send my children there too.

MY DAUGHTER HAVE SPENT TIME AT THE YMCA FOR THE PAST 6 SUMMERS AND 2 HOLIDAY CAMPS. SHE IS 15 NOW AND WISHES TO DO THE C.I.T NEXT SUMMER. SHE LOVE THIS CAMP BUT THE ONLY THING THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IS THAT THE C.I.T PROGRAM FOR NORMAL WORKING PEOPLE IS A BIT MUCH BUT WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOUR TEENAGE CHILD PREFER TO BE IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT INSTEAD OF HANGING AROUND WITH HER FRIENDS DOING NOTHING. EXACTLY! YOU MAKE IT HAPPEN FOR THEM BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST DECISION. WELL ANYWAY THAT'S JUST A SMALL PROBLEM. THE OTHER IS THAT I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME OTHER WAY TO GET THE LUGGAGE UP TO THE CABINS BECAUSE IF YOU ARE STAYING FOR A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME THEN YOU WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF LUGGAGE. I HAVE HAD A FEW PIECES OF LUGGAGE DISTROYED BUT ALL IN ALL THIS CAMP IS WONDERFUL AND I RATHER HAVE MY CHILD SPEND HER WHOLE SUMMBER AT CAMP TALCOT BECAUSE I WAKE UP WITHOUT WORRY AND I GO TO BE WITHOUT WORRY.

Camp Coniston is an amazing camp that changed my entire life. The staff are so carefully chosen, that they are all so caring and amazing you can't help but to love them all! The activities at camp are so much fun! There is almost every type of sport immaginable, there is dance, theatre, swimming, horseback riding, archery, waterskiing, gymnastics, arts and crafts, and about a billion more options. All campers live in a cabin of 10 or 16-I think. It depends the size of the cabin. The bigger the cabin, the more staff live in it with you. The staff are young-ages 17-28(about), and all are soooo nice!! This camp has an amazing kitchen staff too, the meals they prepare for us is like a pretty good restaurant type of food. The memories and friendships I have had at this sleepaway camp are sooo amazing, I love camp Coniston, for it has changed my life forever. I love Camp Coniston!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My daughter loves Camp Jewell and will be returning for yet another summer.  She adores the counselors and she often speaks of her favorite counselor, Kathie.  I have seen real growth in my daughter since attending camp.  Camp Jewell has a huge amount of activities for kids to do as well.  My daughter loves the mini-farm activity which comes complete with chickens, pigs, llamas, horses, goats, and a whole host of other animals.  I feel very safe sending her to Camp Jewell and look forward to sending my second daughter in a few years.

My child has been attending chipinaw for a good number of years and plans on returning. Anytime I have had a problem it was always addressed by the director or head counselor.In terms of the couselors, it is like everything else in life you win some you loose some. They do the best job they can hiring counselors but you really only see how good they are when the kids show up. My chid has made lifelong friends there and  I would highly recommend it.

Replying to the previous comment on the campers mothers death, I'm sure they would have allowed the child to go home!! A councellor this summer went home for a week after her mother died, but decided to return as her family didn't want their kid to be even more upset with missing camp. Oconto is willing to call home if need be. Althought it encourages no phone interactions, this makes the children become independent. this is a great camp for all children. I have gone there one year, and hope to go back again.

As a camper at kennolyn I LOVED every inute of it, which kept me going back for so many years.  I loved and admired every counselor I have ever had and still haev found memories with each of them.  Although not all of the cabins are like staying in the hilton, many of them have there own bathrooms and the ones that don't , just make camp more memorable.  The summers I spent at Kennolyn were the best summers of my entire life!  I highly recommend this camp!

Her year as a waitress was not as positive.  Firstly, i thought the owners exploited them and provided them with no outlets on their days off. Also, that summer there was a conflict with some of the girls, which i thought was very poorly handled by the owners and their children.  I have three other children and chose to send them to other camps, where there are more activites and better facilities for the price. Also, I felt the staff at these other camps were better equipped to deal with children and day to day issues/conflicts which are surely to arise.

After 7 summers there, I made amazing friends I would do anything for. However, most of the kids there are extremely spoiled and obnoxious, and how you're treated is ALWAYS based on how many people know you.

This camp sucks. Possibly the****tiest and snobbiest camp out there. There is a bunch of rich ****s who have grown up having and doing anything they ever wanted. A pure breeding ground for, i dont know, white collar criminals&#63; A bunch of **** kids pretty much run the place. The counselors are jerks too, extremely immature, and unhelpful. The administration is the worst and is very good at putting a fake veneer on their camp for monetary purposes. The camp directors suck too. Nothing good comes out of this camp. There were countless fights, and crappy school activities. The kids think their great at sports, but their not. Their fake athletes. Never send your kid here if you want the best for them and want them to be happy. Most likely, the camp director will put a post under this right after me denying everything i said. Don't listen to any crap they say. I will be posting back.

My child had the most miserable time at this VERY EXPENSIVE SNOB camp.  The counselors were trained to kowtow to the kids whose families had the most money or the most kids at the camp.&lt;br&gt;The counselors were great, but the owners STUNK.  They have their 'favorite familes' and the rest can shrivel up and die.  It is merely a money machine, banking on keeping spoiled JAPPY brats happy so Rich Dad spends more bucks at Kenwood/Kenmont next year.  STAY AWAY!

Decent camp with great facilities but it's so huge it's almost unmanageable. Populated mostly by nasty, self-absorbed Long Island kids with nasty, self-absorbed parents, but there are a lot of exceptions to that. Directors are well-intentioned but completely phony. They spend so much time & effort on marketing and selling the place and producing promotional videos that they've forgotten how to run it, so they have to make stuff up and exaggerate because they don't know what's really going on. Take whatever they tell you on tour with a grain of salt; some of it is wishful thinking and some of it is just ridiculous. Dial it down about five notches and you'll get an idea of what camp is really like. Bottom line: Lots of great staff, kids & programs here, offset a bit by some nasty kids, phony directors and overblown sales pitch.

Marc Hoenigfeld is a nasty man and he allows counselors to withhold mail from campers and if a child can't find his/her sheets then they sleep with NO sheets at all. We can't wait to see this camp go out of business.

My family was very dissapointed with Pontiac after attending for a few summers. There wasn't much personal attention paid to the children. We got the feeling that the owners wouldn't know our children if they tripped over them! After the second dissapointing summer, we toured several other camps which offered just as good facilities but had a warmer environment. Would not recommend.

My son went 2 summers but he was never very happy here. He went because his friend went there but overall it was not a great experience for him and I was very dissapointed in the way the camp was run. Very little supervision, it takes a very long time to get a phone call returned if you have a concern and the staff just seemed totally uninterested and uninvolved.   The next 2 summers he went to another sleepaway camp and that was the best decision for him.

My husband and I have just returned from visiting our son up at camp today, and we're sorry to say how disappointed we were with what we saw today, and what we've been hearing over the past few weeks.  Other than the spectacular sweet table that was served in the dining hall, all we saw today was our son wanting to come home, and most of the counsellors and even the director just lounging around and not showing any effort to represent the camp professionally.        Our son has also been writing home a lot saying he's bored and nobody cares about him, with this being his first summer there.  Both myself and older son have gone to this camp in the past, but it most definitely had a more upscale and community-like atmosphere back then.  It's sad to see how downhill this camp has become since.

NO supervision and I totally agree with the comment below that the bunks were always FILTHY!!

i worked here for 2 years and i was mortified they have since renovated so the buildings are nice but it's not a friendly environment it was like i had a stomach ache all the time the staff was encourage to watch kids not interact they hardly had enough staff to do even that and there isn't and singing ( though some don't like that) it's just not good, sadly my ratings were very generous

This camp is for jappy kids only. The staff is ok they are the same as ever other camp. The facilities are real pretty and amazing. The activites are amazing to and the instructers are really amazing. The personal attention is amazing if u are little skinny and cute but if you are fat big and ugly they pay no attention to you. Monetary Value is ok but the camp is way to expensive. xoxo

i thought that camp scherman was horrible! i signed up for river rafting camp last year, and they took us to sacramento! i had no clue where i was going. when i took it up with the counselors, they didnt do much, and one tried to comfort me not because she felt bad, but because she had to. the counselors had very short tempers and were constantly b*tch*ng about going on their breaks. the river rafting was very fun (i recommend it out of all the other units) but when we were back at camp, it was extremely boring. there arent many activities at the camp, but it is a beautiful campground. we had to walk about 1-2 miles to get to the dining room-we were on the other side of the camp. the pool is pretty nice. once again, spectacular view! the camps pretty inexpensive, but i wouldnt recommend it.

My 9 year-old had a good experience for his first time at camp, and especially liked his counselors. However, he did not make many friends and felt there were not enough activities. He also hated the bugs!  He would like to try another camp. My older son had his second experience at YMCA and did not like it very much. Neither did he like the kids or the activities. He is much happier after his experience elsewhere.

Well, as a former camp counsellor, I can say that the negative comments actually are correct - for those parents that think they are not true - remember we were there with your children all day, every day and that the directors are running a business and will of course try to please you. I don't doubt that some of the kids love the friendship side of it. However, all the  international counsellors were treated differently, despite working very very hard. The management were bullies, and I agree that the whole camp was simply a money making venture. I think Justin was wonderful - he held the staff together. Shari is a princess, but harmless. The worst is Cheryl (girl camp leader). God help your child if they actually need something. Please don't be fooled into thinking it these 'key figures' who make your child's time at camp so memorable. THEY DO NOTHING. Counsellors are the ones who do the work - unless one of the fat american favourites who spent all day on the golf cart.Hmmm

I had 3 children who went to west hills(my oldest for 11 years)and I went there when I was younger yet we were treated like they had no regard or respect for us at all. The woman in the office Sheila has the worse attitude of anybody and acts like she is doing you a favor while taking your thousands of dollars. I finally convinced my kids to go to sleepaway camp, best idea yet.  More money (but not by much) considering it's 7 days a week, all meals and much more for them to do.

this was the worst experience of my entire life. it was so cheesy. all of the counselors were horrible and didnt even care about me. it was really obvious who was favored and who wasnt. i went home crying and i warn you about going no matter what you hear. if your not cool you might as well not even try to fit in
-1.0
My daughter hated this camp. I agree with the other comments about the lack of supervision especially for the older groups. They just seemed to be able to do anything they wanted and get into trouble. The idea of picking your activities seemed like a great idea but by the second week of camp it became more of a chore than anything else and if you wanted to do nothing but play with a nerf ball all day that was fine.  I think by spending thousands of dollars on camp we should feel confident our children are enjoying themselves doing different things they would not necessarily do at home and be supervised while doing it.

this was a pretty good camp but wud be better if it was coed. many people agree. also if som1 needs to (NEEDS) contact their parents let them! my close friend and i came 2 oconto 3 yrs in a row. on my 3rd yr (her 4th) she was very upset about the death of her mom and was not aloud 2 phone her dad. or even see her sister in another section of the camp because she might be sleeping! i still dont think this is right. no 1 that ive told does either. i didnt even go this yr! a concerned citizen

My son went there for 2 years and I found it to be very competitive. Its day camp but the athletic directors seem to feel that the kids who are better athletes deserve more attention.  The groups are way too big and the staff at the office who answer the phone act like you are a pain if you call with a question.  Very expensive for a day camp, grounds are pretty but so what&#63; You see hundreds of kids in the pool at one time and it makes sense that nobody is really able to teach them to swim.  Too crowded!!!!!

This camp is an okay camp. The staff is nice, but this camp is WAY TOO ANTI-LAWSUIT. The staff are forced to carry out all the pointless rules. If you do something wrong the senior staff goes crazy.

It was even funnier that the Uppers only had 3 boys in the entire unit.  The July month had over 200, but has always had over 200 every year, so that's no increase what so ever.

The staff members were all lovely. My daughter attended the only week of the summer when the weather was bad, and no one can control the weather, of course! But she was disappointed that she did not get to participate in the activities she signed up for because others beat her to the sign-ups. It seems this could have been handled more fairly -- especially since the activity offerings and frequency were so severely limited by the weather -- so that everyone had a chance to participate at least once. The bathrooms were atrocious. Filthy. And according to my daughter, very few of the toilets were functioning. We found this to be the case on pick-up day.

This camp used to be good, but as everyone's been saying, it's totally falling apart.  Generally speaking, campers go there and have a good time since they're with their friends and away from home and school.  But, the facilities are getting runned down, the GOOD staff and directors are getting bullyed by Malka and the TZC board, and programs are losing quality.  The summer of 2003 was a great summer, but Jono couldn't return as director.  2004 was okay, that's why Bob got to return for 2005.  2005 was AMAZING (with April as well), but they both got treated badly by the board and office, and as a result, 2006 was pretty pathetic, and of course Adam got treated well.  The bottom line is, Malka is the biggest narcisist in the world, and as a result.  The camp is becoming dimishted and dessimated as time goes by.  Campers, when you become staff in 5 years from now, you'll understand.

PLEASE READ THIS: as a mother who sent her child to this camp with high hopes of having a great experience as her first time at camp i was very dissapointed. the counselors were terrible they cursed in front of the campers. i could tell that there was somthing wrong with this camp when i dropped off my daughter but i convinced myself it was just my imagination because i wanted to support my daughter in her desicion of picking this camp. My daughter had to follow he camp director for HOURS so she can call me to go home early. After her sobbing on the phone, I made a suprise visit up and no security stopped me or questioned me. At first I didn't believe the things she said but right when i walked outside there were children actually  flocking to me crying to use my cell phone and children roaming the streets during activity periods!they were feeding baby bottle pops butterfingers and other refined sugar to seniors at ten at night!there was no camp program whatsoever.

The only good thing about West Hills is that its pretty. SO WHAT.  They are rude to parents and the staff is worried about one thing, themselves.  Everyone at this camp from staff to campers have been spoon fed since birth and they are lazy.  Pretty doesnt cut it for over $5000 a summer. Its ridiculous.  They act like they are doing me a favor if i call with a problem they act like im a bother.  Ive called there ONCE all summer.(and apparently it was a problem for me to call because the counselors were so busy that it was okay for another child to kick my son on a few  occasions.  You live and learn and move on.  Next year he will go to Kenwal Day camp where most of his friends go and they have no complaints there.  West Hills is VERY competitive and everyone is busy worrying about who has more expensive sneakers than just having a pure, fun, good time.

my daughter went to this camp last summer and she came back miserable .after i started asking her how her summer was she burstout in tears and told me about it. None of the children there would even bother to talk to her. she made no close freinds and the counslers wuldnt pay attention to her if she tried telling them so. Also she referred to it as a jap camp. I learned that this means the girls there are very materialistic and fake. I would never send any of my children there again. The facilities were okay but she was pleased that she didnt have to do many sports over the summer, it was more of an arts and crafts camp.

I've been going to surprise lake camp for about 9 years and i think its a amazing camp, i think the friendships you make at the camp is unbelieable and lifetime. I am not returning this summer because teenside has way to much drama, and i just dont know if its worth it. But if you can deal with the drama on teenside, then its fine, but overall minus the drama surprise lake camp is proboly the best sleep away camp out there.

My favourite activity would had to have been the radio station/booth [that was really cool] and tennis. The food was okay.

horrible...just horrible. its the PEOPLE! why don't people understand that camp is not about facilities or activities or food or if its traditional. sleepaway camps are all about the people. and if i do say so myself, the girls are jappy. someone said i was accepted in their circle of friends. yeah well what if you're not&#63; think about that before you send your girls to pembroke.

I sent one of my kids to Bayview Glen and it was horrific. The camp director was abrasive and unaccomodating. My child has ADHD and the camp knew this before the summer began. They refused to make any accomodations for my child, and they should have never stated that their camp could work with these types of kids. I  would never recommend this camp. There are much better summer camps in the GTA.

I went here for years. After a while, everything went downhill. Even the past director knows that, because she left to start another camp. Seriously, no one cares about you. All the girls in my cabin were so mean. The activities are... alright, but you get sick of rock climbing and arts and crafts. Most of the people are stuck up. Try another camp, like Muskoka Woods.

this is a camp of total chaos and blah blah blah everywhere.  the director is too young, immature and unprofessional to run the camp and doesn't know how to separate himself from the staff, as he's running the camp with his camper buddies from Billy.  Malka's gone, so now's the chance to get someone who's a better fit and knows how to handle everything, and not to be so selfish.

Camp pontiac is a gorgeous camp to look at once. If oyur kids are from long island it is a shuin not to send them there.  Many kids go there from Long Island. It is a popular camp because of it's fabulous facilities and how much money has been put into it for peoples satisfaction. A.K.A= camp sterile. Now some people find a pretty camp to be everything. But, this should not be true. The camp experience is for everyone to be happy, not just for people who enjoy different things. Their should be no favorites picked by the owners. If iw ere you and wondering whether or nto to send you are your child there, i'd advice you  to keep looking.

They don't even care if you go to activities I could sleep in my bunk all day.. I am a gymnast and my parents wanted me to go a camp where every activity was gymnastics to inhance my chances of a career in gym.  Well, i went to gymnastics whenever i wanted to and came home a half level worse, i had come to lake bryn mawr camp for 2 summers previously and i dont know why i ever left.. I went back to bryn mawr after and it now my 5th summer (i started young) i cant wait to get my angel and i love it so much.. The gymnastics is amazing and the gymnasium is olympic quality

As a parent of a child who couldn't complain more about how this past summer wasn't nearly as good as previous summers, and of a former staff member who got poorly treated by malka and ended up going elsewhere, I could not agree with everyone any more.  I will not pay this much money what so ever, just so that my child can see all his friends again.  It's also ridiculous how for two summers in a row, all of his favourite counsellors (including his own) haven't been back, knowing that many of them would have liked to have returned.  As a result, my children and some of his friends are no longer going to be at this camp, until Malka either comes to her senses, or leaves.

It's just terrible what's becoming about this camp.  Changing a perfectly good two month camp into a 6 week camp&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;  Obviously it's just an insentive to get more July campers to fill in the hundreds of beds available for August,  RATHER THAN a smarter move of just making more effort to recruit more August campers.  There's a reason why many campers don't go for longer than a month, cause they have other plans or they'd be too homesick.  This camp is just getting more rediculous every year.

AMEN to all these comments 100%.  At the rate that things are going, it wouldn't surprise me if the Lowers, Uppers and Seniors amalgamate into one sometime in the near future, just like what happened with the Juniors and Roots in 2006.  It also wouldn't surprise me if very soon from now, the staff will actually be telling the campers the truth when they say There's no Maccabiah this summer!, as they won't be able to afford it with the minimal revenue that this camp is getting.  Somebody really has to charge into the TZC office and say to them It's Malka, or our Children,  make your pick.

I'm 13 and this summer was my first time at sleepaway camp. At first i was really nervous but i found out that lohikan was the BEST time of my life! These past two weeks went by faster than i would've expected! Although all the activities were horrible((bungee jumping gets kinda old after a while)) most of us wound up playing hooky ((as in not filling out the activity card)) cause all the activities were soo unorganized and boring. The one thing that i LOVED about lohikan is the people ((everyone is so nice!)) and the counsolers are so cool and happy to help you. You'll definitly wind up making hundreds of new friends and it's so cool meeting other people from other states ((thats another cool thing about lohikan all the counsolers and kids there are always out of state and some come from different countries!)). Overall i love lohikan except for the activities...      ps. there is no such thing as lake rash and there are no snapping turtles :]]

The camp has been going down hill for the past 3-4 years. There is no stability, as there has been five directors in the past six years. There are a  group of people to blame and that's Malka and the TZC board. I pulled my Children from the camp many years ago, and I would encourage all the other parents to pull thier children as well. For the same cost or less, I want my children to go to a camp with more stability and more imenidities. Good Job board.

I didn't like it. The activities weren't very interesting, and I couldn't get into the ones that I wanted. The facilities were good though, it just seemed too much like a resort than a summer camp. They also said that church was optional, but it wasn't.

Compared to other camps, the staff are way younger and most don't return each summer, the activities are less structured and orgranized, and the monetary value is ridiculous.  Even a camp like Northland is more structured and has more facilities, yet costs way less.  The food is pretty good, and the campers are great friends to have, but other than that, this is definitely not a camp that would keep up well with its competitors.

It is a real LOng Island camp , the kids seem to like the camp, beacuse it is a big hang out place, no structure at all. The parents hate the place , as the owners are only interested in the $$$ , so don't forget to bring your wallets on visiting day they sell everything, including the water. When you arrive , they are trying to sell evrything, photos, ice cream, snacks etc.The word is that they raise prices in the canteen for the stupid parents on visting day and then they sell them water by the camp fire. I guess the owners count all the dollar bills when the parents leave and laugh all the way to the bank. The camp never fill up , if the have more kids that want to go they just build more bunks. I think they are up to 800 kids now, but they don't tell you that. So if you want your kids to hang out for the summer with all the long island kids its a great place. Good luck

i went to this camp a long time ago. the staffing waas terrible. they paid no attention. the food wasnt that bad which was surprising . i vaguely remember this camp, but i remember those friday nights in that steaming hot barn , watching plays which i never was casted in. its a great camp and it started off my sleep away experiences, even as an extremely young camper. the water tastes terrible but i really would recomend this camp.

This camp was an absolute nightmare for my daughter and they are lucky I didn't sue them. She got sick (a virus was going around)with 103 temperature while there and the infirmary and division counslors did not notify me for over 24 hours. My daughter was deprived clean underwear and bathing facilities for nearly 2 days while she was incredibly ill.  I had to threaten to drive up there and bring the police before she received proper care. Also, phone calls were handled so poorly that sometimes camp staff took days to return calls and this is your only method of finding out how your child is doing, since campers cannot call or email and it can be a full week before you get a snail mail letter

staff is more concerned with dating then taking care of the kids..  the facilities are maintained very nicely.   there are plenty of activities but too many children so they dont get to use them often enough.   the personal attention is horrible because its overcrowded there.  Its worth the money  but worth no more than any of the other camps within a three mile radius that have ALL the same activities.. . bigger grounds and half as many campers(so they get the attention they need)

if you want your child to feel badly about themselves and become interested in materialistic things, then this is the camp for you.  no one knows who my child is and i was not treated nicely when i was there.  it attracts a certain type of family (the one who is superficial and self-important)  This is how the staff behaves also.

Say that first time campers get a full refund for the days they leave early but good luck getting out.... they told my mom they would call her after i despratly hacked the computer so that my parents would get my hate letter (the only email that got to my parents)at 9 the next morning and the camp director actually told me lets preted this didnt happen and wasnt going to call! If that wasnt bad enough i had to stalk her down so i was able to finally call at 11 30 after my mom was waiting by the phone since 7 and she was on the other phone listening to our conversation

This camp is satanic. I worked as a staff member this year and let me tell you, if you think they give a damn about your kid, you're in for a real shock. The staff is AMAZING, but the head of the camp are evil, horrible, and greedy people. They will do anything or say anything to get your money. Seriously, they don't care about anything or anyone. By the end of camp counselors were literally dropping like flies because the camp abused the staff so badly. Forget about eating or sleeping, they don't let you do either b/c the child always comes first(which is how it should be) but if you're on your death bed you still have to slap a smile on your face b/c they won't even let you see the doctor. I have never been more sick or exhausted in my whole life. From the staff who went for a great time (but were quickly mistaken), to the abused horses and facilities all over camp that were falling apart. DO NOT SEND YOUR CHILD THERE OR THINK ABOUT WORKING THERE. TYLER HILL IS THE WORST CAMP ALIVE!!

After reading some of these reviews, I have concerns but my son and daughter went for half the summer and liked it. I keep waiting to get the call to pick them up early.

THe director is not very professional at all.  His staff are really the ones who work hard and ensure that campers have fun by force of habit, and as a result are the ones who make him look so good.

I worked at this camp and left disspointed and underpaid.  They make it sound so appealing but when calculated out we made less then $24.00 a day. We only had one evening off and one morning off a week, but to be working 24hrs a day when NOT off. Upper staff is horrendous and out for your dollar, they SERIOUSLY under pay their staff. Kids will be kids, let them have fun. It seemed almost TOO structured to be considered summer camp. If you're going away all summer and want to DITCH your kid at camp, why not make them remember that you left them at summer camp while you went to Europe. Leave them at Kenwood/Kenmont and they'll never forget how cruddy their summer vacation was.  I loved my campers but the camp was too much money for what you get.

I went to this camp for three years and I kept hoping it would get better. That didn't happen. This camp has too many sports. Some councelors were mean. Alot of japs go here.

Our daughter attending camp Chipinaw for 5 years. Nice camp for the first 4 years. She started at Chipinaw when she was 8yrs old. She will not go back again. The reason for this is simple. The owners have become fixated with money. The bunks are over crowded and hot. Five years ago there were less kids and more emphasis on the children.  Now it is clearly only about money. After paying tuition they charge you for everything. Our daughter needed an antacid one night and we were charged $15 and $3 for each phone call home. We can certainly afford this however it is annoying. Our daughter was the one who told us she felt like no one cared about her.  After the end of this season, we decided to speak to the owner about an incident. This is after getting nowhere with the head counselor. It was not a big deal and an “I’m sorry this happened” would have been enough. The owner was defensive and smug. We decided to listen to our daughter. Well, not all good things last.

I went to this camp for a year before I went to Camp Longhorn.... I hated it so much, I tried to BREAK MY ARM so that I could go home. I had my cabinmates jump on me. It only sprained it so I had to stay. It was horrible. Don't even give it a try, you'll regret it.

This is a camp with fine facilities, and a great place for children to make new friends and not feel left out for being new, but is totally not worth the money spent for it.  Other YJ camps like Kinneret and Kadimah also have that vision of promoting more friendship and less of a top-class facility atmosphere, but they charge way way less than Shalom.  They also treat their staff well, and make every effort to ensure the camp's growth and success, and that every tradition and aspect of camp that the campers like, get KEPT, and not tampered with.  Shalom has only been fracturing within the past few years, and this is all 100% true.  Having less than 100 campers in August, when there should be over 200 is absurd.  Having the best head staff getting fired for no reason is ridiculous.  Honestly, I can't say anything more than WHY MUST THIS HAPPEN&#63;

Camp is not snobby -- I think it would LIKE to be called that! haha! But it is NOT true. (The camp directors are posting that the kids are snobby -- they wish... Then, they say the camp is great haha!!  You must see that these are  posts from the camp directors.) Snobby means rich and discerning.  In fact, it is so poorly run and is a LAST RESORT  for many troubled kids/behavior problems. MANY OF KIDS WERE KICKED OUT OF OTHER CAMPS OR NOT ASKED BACK.  That is their unspoken niche.  But, where they should have specialists to work with kids whose ADD, etc. is out of control, they have teenagers who do not know how to treat or handle them.  MAYHEM ENSUES.  Snobby implies rich and discerning -- and that is NOT the way to describe the people at Pontiac.  Low class and troubled kids with troubled families would be accurate.  Anyone with troubled kids like that, who has any brains or class, knows they need REAL help -- not to dump them at Pontiac for babysitting. They are glad to know the

They were cold and no one in my division even wanted to go in. Lake was no better. The fields were covered in goose****.  They had almost no instruction in anything.

My child enjoys the camp but there are too few kids in the August session due to so many parents opting for other camps because this one is overpriced for what is offered and was so poorly run in the past. The jury is out on where it will go from here.On the plus side, there are a lot of counselors per cabin but that is probably because they stick around all summer and the camp goes from 200 and something in July down to under 100 in August. My child liked the counselors but we did not meet them on visitors day as they were not in the cabin as they had been in previous years. That is not proper in my opinion. The number one attraction is the food, which is good, but they can get good food at home. I have to wonder why they went all month without one campfire. The kids seem to like the camp but when you are there you have to wonder why. They need to keep the fees in closer touch with the reality of what they offer.

it's kind of cheap compare to other camps, but you get what you paid for. My son and 3 of his friends went and lost a lot of weights. Might be a good idea if you want your kids to lose weight. Not enogh food, not enough the first serving, most of the time food ran out so there was no second serving. some kid lost as much as 15lbs a summer. Group punishment is enforced when only one kid misbehaved. Promises from administration was made but never fulfilled. I guess that's what you call Surprise! By the way, a lot of good reviews always folled by the bad one. something's fishy here.

OMG WORST CAMP EVERRRR. The food was HORRIblE, the activities were boring, and the counslers were weird. Every morning you had to clean your cabin which was like cleaning the toilets and stuff. then you would go to a church type thing that was soooo boring. Then you would go raise the flag which took like a half an hour but it felt like and hour. You would have beakfast, which was almost the same everyday. After that you would go do an office chore where you would like clean the office. OMG everythinhg was sooooooo boring. You has to pick like three activites and you had to keep them for a whole week!! Alot of camps you get to pick new things everyday. Ughh I hateee camp jewell!!!! I went with my school and it was a amazing but the summer camp is COMplEtLEY different. NEVER go to camp jewell!!!!!

I went to this camp when I was in gr.2. They were really annoying. Some staffs were really nice but some were really annoying. In the swimming pool, a kid pooed in it once. It was really annoying. Now I go to their school and it is a total waste of money. Their food is simply awful. There is always hairs or some sort of weird things in it. It sucks! They don't really pay attantion to you, they just flirt away. It is disgusting! NEVER GO THERE! Tell your parents!

My son went to Chipinaw for 3 years .This camp has a nice pool and beautiful lake. We found a much better camp for this summer. This camp has been on a decline in caring for the campers needs. It looks great on the outside, but average to poor where it counts.

This camp was well..just not fun. No affence or anything but i feel like i just wasted my time in it. Its fun for more of the little kids like 3 or 4 cause i have a little girl that i know and shes 4. She said it was boring and the cups fir snack smell!

yeah, the facilities are nice, but the kids, for the most part, really are jappy and materialistic, more so than other camps with a lot of rich jewish kids. i went here for a few summers, until i finally realized that this was like being back home in my jappy town, only without the schoolwork of the year.

The staff is very lazy   The facilites are pretty   the camp is very competitive(too competitive) so kids go home feeling bad if they lose at something.   There is NO personal attention at all and it is not worth what it costs to attend there.

ATTENTION TO ALL PARENTS (and if you read this, then PLEASE tell others):  The TZC Board and M.K. (initials) have the FINAL AUTHORITY on the camp, but they are the ones responsible for what's been going on lately (BIG TIME!).  Their personal politics and beliefs are why the directors keep changing every year, why the August enrollment keeps dropping (as it's nearly down to half of what it should be), and why over 60% of the staff each summer keep not returning lately (particularly the head staff, older and more qualified/experience staff).  It is understandible that your children may be happy enough there (especially since they're with their friends and away from school), but in the long run, this will NOT help the camp.  At this point it is clearly up to you guys to do whatever needs to get done, in order for this camp to improve (and PLEASE, do it quickly!!!)

It shouldnt be called a camp they call you Guests not Campers !  The bunks and rooms are older but its fairly good overall.  Manily made up of larger then life egos though...

I went to this camp with mmy school in sixth grade and it was soo much fun and there were great classes.  Then I went in the summer and found that it was boring and the classes and the camp sucked.  First of all we had these horrible cabins with flaps to cover the screens which were supposed to be windows, secondthe flagpole was so annoying, imen just put up the flag already.  Oh and by the way we had to clean our cabin everyday including the toilets and most of the time without a brush, and if we did a good job we got an icepop, im not four.  Also we had to go to chapel everyday which was almost like church.  Then msot of the counselours were forgn sio they barely spoke English.  Also the singing gets old after a while I mean reaally.  We sang before like every meal and it was either about talking animals or praising God.  It was almost like it was somesort of religious camp.  If you donnt want to sing all day and go to church with happy skippy idiots then stay away from this camp.

This is a VERY traditional camp, that is very set in its ways.Unfortunately, many of the older campers become bored, which has lead to the camp being dominated by the 7-11 set.The activities are not very interesting, which also leaves many teenagers bored.The camp owner is constantly vying for the attention of younger girls, and is looked upon in disgust by the rest of the camp.   This is a good camp for very young girls, and will get them to love camp, but they won't want to come back when they're 13 unless theyve made some VERY good friends.Also much too strict in terms of male (tripper) contact, which leads to promiscuity among the staff.
-1.0
I must say that the Staff and facilities are very good, but over, this is a very bad camp. Malka, who is the head of the camp, is ruining camp. This year I was a senior. Thank God! Now I can go off and have some fun at Soleliem. Camp Shalom SUCKS!

I enjoyed my time at this camp, but just because of some of the counselors and division leaders that worked there. The owner is not very nice and seems to worry about saving his behind more than letting us have fun. They also don't bring back the best staff every year. This year my counselor was not allowed to come back for my last year even though he had been there 5 years and had never done anything wrong. I had a lot of good times, but the activities got very old, and they wonder why kids don't return.

I was an international staff member at this camp a few years ago and the camp had a lot of problems retaining staff at that time. I was under the impression that there would only be a handful of international staff but the Australians and New Zealanders basically out numbered the rest. There were very few returning consellors. Large problems with treating staff equitably. I was a trained and experianced high school teacher and to be honest I have never been treated less like a professional than I was at this camp. There were numerous personality clashes with the campers in our cabin that I tried to raise on a number of occassions with any one who was above me who would listen, though all was in vain as apparently the same issues had been raised in previous years. My second session campers were AMAZING however I would not go back to this camp again. Overall I agree that there is a strong veneer applied to many aspects of this camp.

I went here when I was thirteen, and had a horrible week. Three of the four counselors mostly neglected the campers and had short tempers. They were also not attentive to camper health. The facilities are excellent, however, the camp is just too large. Walking anywhere takes a lot of time in the heat. This was a few years ago, but even as a counselor elsewhere last year, my campers told me it was the same.

We were very disappointed in FWF after our children went there for 3 weeks this summer. It is very loosely supervised. The counselors are not well trained in comforting homesick kids or in creatively distracting them. Our son's counselors playfully referred to the boys in the bunk as shitheads and worse. Our kids were exposed to some really inappropriate stuff thanks to the older (teenage) campers there. The camp offers tutoring for those kids who need to do some summer work. We were assured there would be qualified high school students to monitor their work and be available to answer questions. There was no one at all available. Instead, the kids were shown to a room off the lounge where they worked on the floor with teenagers sleeping nearby. Apparently, a lot of cursing went on in all quarters on a daily basis. Not only were we sorely disappointed, we feel we were misled by the camp's brochures, management and head counselors.
-1.0
A good camp, but facilties are mediocre.  Showers have had problems and bunks need re-constructing.  Counselors are pretty nice, except for the occasional lazy one.  Very good selection of activities, but a few activities are not followed through.  Campers get personal attention really only when it is really needed.

I hated this camp. Everything was so hard to find, and there was no one to help you. The bunks were gross. Also, you HAD to be at every activity. There was no time to just rest at your bunk.

My son goes to this camp and my daughter goes to another(because thats where their friends are)..  This camp is not very accomodating and they never know who we are when we go to pick up my son(how could they with all those campers&#63;)  Its about 600 dollars more than the other camp my daughter goes to and my daughter seems to do much more at her camp and they are very personal over there.  If it were up to me(id send them both to the other camp) but my son wants to be with his friends (which i understand)    but I feel much more comfortable at the other camp.   No worries over there at all. When it comes to our children we can get a bit neurotic and I never feel that way about the other camp.. Im totally at ease over there and that camp is right up the road from my sons camp   West Hills has good activities abut my son hardly uses them because its too crowded there.

as someone who went here for 3 summers, i did not like this camp, there was scarcely any supervision, and also the camp is very cliquey. If you haven't gone there since you were like eight or nine, then chances are you will have a hard time making friends because the campers tend to be very jappy and snobby. Also the bunks are gross, and the owners play favorites, and their favorites get preferential treatment.

Amazing camp. everyone should go! People are soo kind

I went there a long time ago, so perhaps things have changed.  I have many horror stories though from my three years there, including a too young 15-yr old head counselor when I was only 8, being forced to share a bed with another girl because they ran out of space, being forced to eat food I despised, and hiking to a candy store on a busy road on Shabbat (for years this is what I thought hiking was supposed to be).  I know many people love this camp, but perhaps you have to be a certain kind of kid and get lucky with counselors you have. Although tradition can be great, I think it mires this camp down, because there are many traditions left (although perhaps now gone, I don't know) that are very antiquated and cruel, such as handing out different size Ts at the end of the session depending on how good a camper you were.  It was always clear that it depended on popularity and was quite hurtful to many of us.
-1.0
i was a staff member last summer (go 06!) the campers are great, but unfortunately aside from a few key staff members, the heads are far out of touch, the camp is in need of major restoration and  ken is just a horror of a director. Jordan is not as bad, though he does frequent the rumor mill and allow that to become truth, as his voice is the be all end all. You will notice a difference in atmosphere when the camp is being inspected by the state or when the  UJA heads and the Investors come to visit. The campers are a delight and the only reason i wish   to return. counselors are awesome, and some love it, (Most likely where campers themselves) and the others hate it, as per the facilities. more than likely they do not return. sexual activities happen frequently. very frequently, counselors for the most part try to let the kids get away witit, but jordan has a harsh one time your out policy for sneaking out at night, which is very different from competition, ie Monroe. Go Elsewhere.
-1.0
It's pretty obvious that the last oh..39 ratings that were done over a 2 DAY TIME PERIOD were done by either the owners of the camp or basically the same person who rated over and over.  If anyone wants to know the TRUE rating of this camp they should scroll back to the beginning and read the ACCURATE picture painted by former campers and parents.
-1.0
The camp may have a horrible executive director, but the reality is that the director Adam Shulman is 10x worse.  Ever since he was offered this job back in January (as the only person who actually was willing to accept the job), the camp has been getting worse and worse.  This is all because he's just not experienced or MANLY enough to stand up to Malka as the director, unlike previous directors (Bob, Jono, Sable, Aubrey) who were experienced professionals (over 30 years old with full time jobs) that would stand up to her, only the make sure the camp runs smoothly and strongly.  Adam is in his mid 20s, and is pretty much making a living off of his camp job, which is why he's more concerned about keeping his job at camp (and letting other people suffer) than standing up to Malka (knowing Malka might retaliate on him) and running the camp well.

I worked at this camp and I am sorry to say that it was a descision that I regret.  Sure there were some great things about the camp, mainly the activities.  But I agree that there were favorites from the owners and I am even going to include the division directors and head counselors also.  It seems like you have to be part of the clique to get anything or have anything taken care of.  I felt sorry for the parents who are spending close to $6000 for their kids to be in school.  I worked at another camp this summer and it was one of the greatest times ever....kids picked what they wanted to do. Another thing about KenMont and KenWood is that they did serve chicken and pasta A LOT.  I know it is cheaper, but they serve it to a point of being ridiculous.  There were days when I felt like just walking down the road to Kent and finiding my way back home, but I stayed for the kids.  The kids were the only thing that made the summers special for me.  Personal attention was paid to very few..

I am glad someone has finally targeted one of the real problems accurately in this camp-Cheryl. Cheryl, the head counselor, is the reason many of their campers do not come back to Chipinaw. She has little to do with the children but the worst part is that she is a cruel person who is unresponsive to the children’s needs. She has been known to ruin camper’s experiences at Chipinaw and they don’t return back. That is what happened to my child after 4 years. The worst part about it is that the owners do nothing about it. When they are informed by people, they look away. They support her at the camper’s expense. They leave Cheryl to remain as Head Counselor summer after summer and in turn, more and more campers who are away from home are made miserable.Buyer beware, love your kid.

My child has fun because his friends are there BUT  its VERY impersonal and when I went to pick my child up the other day it took a VERY long time to find him , because again,  it has way too many kids and your child will easily get lost in a CROWD.    Because there are so many children they really do not have much time to do each activity.   Cost way too much for what they offer. Next year we will try another camp that is known for personal attention.

Camp Tawingo.  Where do I begin&#63;  This was probably the worst god damn vacation I have ever been on.  I wouldn't have gone if it wasn't my school's Grade 8 Grad trip.  The staff were incompitant (such as Ahmed, Claire, and Bobby).  The facilities were awful.  Dripping sealings, unclean bathing facilities, and bed made out cardbord.  The food was re-used, and the food was not good in the first place.  The activities were horrible...if you did what you were suppost to do.  We didn't do what we suppost to do, and what we did still sucked.  Off course, they payed excellent attention to us; they never got off of our backs!  Thank god they didn't sleep in the same cabin as us or we wouldn't have been able to stay up 24HRS a row!  And, $250.00 for three days&#63;  Rip Off!  If you want to go on a good camping vacation, go to The Pinery, or Camp Forest Cliff.   Do not waste your money and time on the hell hole that somebody went and named Camp Tawingo.

The camp lived up to it's name: SURPRISE! Food wasn't enough, they never give enough for the fisrt helping, when you go back for more, no food left. My son and all 5 of his friends lost weighs. When one kid in the unit did something wrong, the whole unit got punished. When my younger son was there, his counselor confiscated his bunk's sunblock. (apparently he didn't bring enough for himself) When asked by other why he did it, he was liked:I don't give a beep about the kids Request was promised but never fulfilled, any complaints usually get brush off. The camp is cheaper compare to others, but trust me, it's a poorly run camp and I'm really sorry I sent my 2 kids there.

A dismal camp. Turned out to be the complete opposite of what was sold to us during the dog and pony show that the owners put on during the camp visit. Massive and disorganized. Owners seemed more concerned with impressing the parents than focusing on the children. Incidences of neglegent counsellors abounded - several were dismissed halfway through camp. Would not recommend.

It was an okay camp, what made it fun were the campers. If you plan on going here you should start at a young age because mostly everyone makes their friends when they are younger. There were three counslers to a bunk, and sometimes two of them would go out and not come back until the early morning on their nights off. They also allowed cursing in the cabins and even thought there is a chore wheel the cabins seem to get very very dirty. This is not the camp for everyone.

Everyone is allowed to have a say, and if someone leaves feedback that is negative, then that is their right and a reflection of their experience. And if camp directors need to leave positive comments to bump up their ratings, then that's very transparent. Michael and Shari sure do put a lot of money back into 'his' camp. It's an asset, and it's growing in value the more money they put in. What a shame the family environment at Chipinaw has been lost. Some things are far more important than money and it's a pity that the person who runs this 'business' does not understand that. Enjoy your friends, focus on them and know when it's time to move on with them and leave this camp behind. Such a shame for a situation that should have been so great. Such a shame for such a pretty lake. Make the most of every day, summer and winter, with your friends and the people who inspire and mentor you, they are the part's of the 'summer camp' experience that count.

Let me add another concurrence re: the owners' disproportionate emphasis on marketing, as the camp has essentially turned into one big sales pitch. The directors spend so much more time and effort SELLING it than RUNNING it that the camp, its programs and its people must necessarily suffer as a result. But please, folks, could you spare us the BS about the camp being filthy or disorganized, the made-up nonsense about rats and public nudity, the clichéd exaggerations about the food and crowding, and the ad hominem generalizations about the population, because it's all just simply not true. The camp has excellent facilities, staff and programs, and a population that by and large loves the place and each other, but it is not immune to the social and economic issues that plague every camp in the industry to one degree or another. Maybe Pontiac is not for you; if that's the case, say so, but don't resort to broad, sweeping and unsupportable claims to make that point.

alright heres the deal with kenwood kenmont. well i went there and the director let me tell you, she's a witch. second, the camp is SO unorganized and really rather repetitive. also, if nothings wrong with you or anyone in your bunk, you division leader or head councelor might just pick on someone for a random reason. and lastly, the fights are endless. you go and find a day where there isnt someone hating another camper. thats my completely honesp opinion. and i will be honest again, i have made friendships there that will last FOREVER AND EVER but also enemies. and you know what&#63; i could have done int anywhere else and it wouldnt be any different.. possibly better than the experience that i had at that camp.

the food is inedible, NO DECENT activities, The counselors ore inexperienced, my child as well as 5 others we know who attended complained about doing the same thing everyday.  the worst. also one of the kids who eats anything , lost 8 lbs, they all complained ablot lack of things to do, and boredom, the camp has literally no facilities,there is a lake , thats pretty much it, an oh yea, a Ga-Ga box which consists of a ball and a wood box to try and hit other kids in. thats it. The kids are much of the time running wild. good luck.the camp is not a good value at all if you consider the lack of everything except sleeping quarters, which are on the low end as well, but it is camp. there is canteen only twice or three times a week so the kids cannot starve to death. The letters we received home were disturbing.

After the third day of sewage overflowing accross the cabin floor, finally someone wandered into the cabin who knew how to use a plunger. Staff could not attend to children because of overlapping duties.  For a camp in such a beautiful area I was dismayed that our kids never were alowed or assisted in exploring any sort of nature activity or hike.  Too much time spent doing inane things like bungee jumping for hours each day.  Kids with legitimate problems were dismissed as just being homesick. Not an emotionally healthy place for kids.  Very flashy activities, no character.

It had fun activities during the night. But they were too strict. SIX COUNCILARS IN A CABBIN!!!!!! The days got boaring. The owners had favorites. The camp is expensive. They only had chicken and pasta to eat. You also had no privacy, They should be more careful who they pick as their councilars. The Lower camp had no fun cause they treeted them like babies. Upper camp had more fun. We had to clean our cabbins like the shower. WHEN IT IS A 7,000 DOLLAR CAMP. I know a lot of people who left KenWood and liked it or didn't like it and went to another camp and loved that camp a lot better. KenWood only has 1 phone call. Some camps have like a phone like when ever you want after the first week. There were a lot of cliques which they could of controled, a lot of people complained and they did NOTHING about the clique. They lied to visting parents that eveyr bunk was the same. They would show the big bunks and say that all of the bunks were the same . Oveerall, the camp was a waste of time.

Muskoka Woods can NOT be called a summer camp! It's not camp like at all! It is a resort where snobby teenagers go to talk about there booze drinking and how many girl/boy friends they have had. it's full of horrible girls and guys who just show off the whole time. The councilers don't care how you feel and just try and cover up that you are sad to 'promote' the camp. I hated my summer there.

My son was not a happy camper last year! He normally  makes friends very easily, however at this camp it seemed very 'clicky'. The counselors were not interested in activities and were not nice to the kids. Everything seemed rushed and not relaxed. Sorry, my boy is going elsewhere!

The kids and staff were horrible. The only nice people are the Camp Directors. The best part was when I left.

i did not like this camp, there are not enough activities. all the kids do is play gaga all the time and swim twice a day, and eat. sometimes eating and food related activites are schedualed up to 6 times in a day (including meals).

I worked at this camp for one year and found that it was extremely based on popularity and those who are interested in materialistic and trivial things. Yea the campers enjoy it because it is a means of escaping reality for 2 months where everyone is like them but for a person who has experienced college and beyond and lived beyond the borders of materialville I know better than to return to such a closed-minded environment. The only thing good was the food and that's not saying much. Needless to say, I thought the owners were not the least bit genuine. Enough said.

Horrible horrible horrible!  I threw away everything I got for this camp.  I dont ever want to remeber my time there.  It was so terrible. The food was junk, all they served was chicken and pasta, like somebody else said.  It is also true that they have favorie kids.  I was not one HAHA  They like the kids who are bullies.  It was just stuck up and horrible.
