He was syndicated in my city on regular radio and I listened for awhile, but I finally got bored.  Tell the truth, he just sounded kind of tired.  Maybe the new format will fire him up, but how challenging and hungry can you be if you're worth . . . a half billion dollars!!  I think young Howard would make fun of old Howard.  Besides, Sirius equipment is junk.  I went with XM and I find OnA to be more than a worthy replacement, they're very funny.  Sorry, Howard.

JV & Elvis put O&A in their place What are you talking about All they did was spew lies and turned down the volume on the phone call so that their listeners couldnt hear what O&A were saying. Jim Norton did not curse, his comment was dumped out of cause JV & Elvis did not want their listeners to hear Jim's great point. They lie about coming up with the comedy show, they lie about their ratings, they lie about having drinking problems even though the audio is online, they claim they are about to tell managment they are quiting then 15 minutes later they play O&A commercials and comply when the station allegedly tells them to stop talking about O&A. JV & Elvis have been around 13 years and are on middays in one city. O&A have been on since 1994, were off the air for 2 years yet are on satellite radio and sindicated all across the country. Who has the better showListen to the unedited, undumped audio on Opie and Anthony's website, then tell me who got put in their place. Go back to SF.

I would have given them a five, however their liberal rants become annoying, when that happens I usually change the dial.  They should stick to what they know best and politics is definately not it.

Please find your way back to 99.5.  They are so much fun to listen to.  I can't tell you how many times I have laughed my head off listening to these guys.  Like their last show when they sent slacker sammy around the day after halloween to trick or treat.  that was too funny.  Or sending tea pot tim to the hotels for a swim.  They have more style, creativity and originality than any other show out there.

I think the show is boring now compared to before he left, but It is still worth Sirius... That being said I have to say alot of the negatives on here are from Opie and Anthony fans. But the gag order can't be thrown around here, because Jv and Elvis were gagged by them too.  Its one vicious circle of radio.

I've listened to tons of radio shows during my life. There has never been a more fun show than the Doghouse. These guys just know how to put on a great radio show. PURE ENTERTAINMENT, the 4 hours these guys FLY BY and I can't wait until the next show.  NYC is lucky to have the Doghouse, the west coast has known for years and now we get a piece of the action and NYC is loving them.

I've got to agree with the last poster.  I am a Doghouse diehard, but this week was a trainwreck.  I've talked to a lot of fellow JV and Elvis faithful to feel let down by the guys.  I've never been much of an Opie and Anthony fan, but you have to admit that they totally exposed JV and Elvis.  It hurts me to think that our guys are cheap shot artists and worst of all, LIARS.  But sadly, it seems so.  Goodbye dogs hello O and A.

If you're not in love with this show, then you don't live in Anchorage!    Shannyn opens her program ebery morning telling her loyal listener's how many cups of coffee she's had, and that she has her Bonnie Bell lipsmackers on and is ready to roll.     I guess the image of the lipsmackers doesn't mean much to anyone not in the listening zone, but if you've seen Miss Shannyn in person, ZOWIE!   She's got the leftie dudes as well as the rightie dudes in love with her and that is no lie!   1080 am radio has really come a long way since they went on the air.   And thanks to shows like Shannyn's, they're going to be around after other stations have long faded.    Insanely good program!   Mark

The O&A Show isn't as good as they think it is. They seem to have a great time with Jimmy pronouncing certain words in an odd way. i.e- BA-laouse (blouse) When the VA killer did his thing, they had great points and views, but on slow news days, they just have nothing good to say. Here in Las Vegas, the show is being switched to AM radio. I've listend to the show nearly every weekday since they've started in Vegas, and I think I've given it enough time to let it soak in to me. I can't stand the show for more than 30 minutes, and I listen just because I'm a fan of talk radio. I'd say, just keep the show on XM. With the merger done, you think the O&A fans will be calling into Howard's show

The RMS is the best show in DFW.  For those who believe that he is just a redneck or white trash you are correct.  He says that himself.  He was born and raised in Pleasant Grove and yes his dad really did set tile for a living.  He has since moved WAYYYY up in the world and I wish we had more like him.  If you want original radio you will have to move to another planet because every bit has been done and rehashed since the invention of radio.  The reason Russ is funny doing it is because the listeners can all relate to it.  One original thing is that there are no other D.J.s in DFW that do what Russ does for firefighters, police and animals.  He has a soft heart for children as well.  Kidd only does the things that he does for ratings, he really couldn't care less about Kidd's Kids and he has a fat wife :&gt;  Listen or turn the channel, Russ won't care and neither do I.

O&A's true ratings say it all... this is fact. If you are non biased, have common sense, and know how to use google you will find this out via their ratings. Their rise since they have come back on the air on both XM and terrestrial is unprecedented. At the rate they are going, there is no need to defend them. The proof will be shown with time. If you have doubts, use google and search for radio ratings. I go by statistics and facts, not people’s opinions. You will find that they have over 1 million listeners on terrestrial radio and around 5 million on XM and even these numbers are conservative (unlike Howards lies of success on Sirius, look that up too on google and you can actually how Howard  exaggerates). Not bad for a show that just got back on the radio after a 2 year absence Their syndications are growing yearly, along with their fanbase. This is your idea of failure If you do not like O&A, turn it off and stop complaining.

More or less just the Opie and Anthony name.... The political climate we live in has destroyed their show. No attitude or risky stuff, and I suspect they will continue the P.C radio because of the Satellite merger and one Mel K.'s probable decision to boot them.  The only duo who were able to still pull off a good shock jock style show for a while was the fired Jv and Elvis which were actually quite entertaining even with all the FCC and company restrictions.

Drew and Mike have the best morning radio show in the country and I've heard most of the others across the nation. I have been listening to them since Zip (Drew's old partner) was replaced with Mike. Granted their show is not what it used to be, we all have Janet Jackson to thank for that. These guys blew Howard Stern out of this market when he was syndicated on another Detroit station. Howard quietly left after boasting he was going to run them off the air.

The below comment is a Stern diehard no doubt. I have listened to both O & A and Stern for a very long time. Stern had his day, and is still entertaining at times but really has nothing new to say. It's pretty much the same old thing over and over most often. O & A , are not Stern clones, they have some of teh same 'shock' jock elements to their show but thats called radio. O & A aren't doing the best in all markets but if you look at the ratings neither did Stern. I love the radio war between them so I'm looking forward to their on-air battles, makes great radio.

Stern rocks, he is a legend and continues to produce great radio.  Just look at what all the replacements in his old markets.  Their ratings are dead, and as stern as said he is The Last of Dying breed.  The only good radio is Sirius Satellite Radio, and the NAB knows it, thats why they don't want a merger, so one of the two companies will fold and they can try to regain the markets that they lost when stern and a lot of his fans left and went to Satellite radio.

This show sucks, he makes up stories, ALL Husker talk is negative, Way too much Missouri Valley Basketball. When is this guy going to propose marriage to Dana Altman live on the air Nobody in this area cares about Boston, or Alabama, yet he talks about them constantly. Has no clue how the real world operates. He was really mature on 10/4 when he cut off Travis Justice's mic when he didn't agree with him about taxes paying for the new Ballpark. Perrault wants to be a full-fledged East Coast A-hole, but is nothing but a whiny little crybaby. To those who say Perrault is a Jim Rome wannabe, that is completely wrong. Jim Rome is intelligent and has a sense of humor. Perrault is a humourless moron who cares only about his own agenda.

Although Artie sleeping is getting annoying, the show is still the best entertainment on radio. He is the best interviewer bar none. His wit and commentary on what is happening around the world is open and honest which I admire even if i disagree. He is a great entertainer and that is shown when there are no guests and no planned bits. Just to listen to his humorous or passionate response to anything and everything is magic and can't be found anywhere else. He is as committed as ever to producing a great show each day, and he delivers by tossing political correctness out the window. He cares more about entertaining you than having you agree with what he says. He is open and honest about his day to day life, which makes him the originator of the reality shows. This isn't surprising though, as he has influenced and originated countless shows and people in today's entertainment industry. Long live the King.

I tried listening to his new show.  But it was just plain awful.  Thank god i didn't pay for his show and just downloaded the torrents.  And who the hell listens to the Howard 100 news  Do we really need an hour long show about each time howard takes a dump  He's been doing subpar radio for years now.  And this just proves it to everyone, cause even though he can't hide behind the FCC and bush anymore, he still will not do an entertaining show. Stop recording old outdated bits and do some new and fresh bits.  Stop whining about yourself.  Stop talking about the move to sirius. You are already there!  Stop avoiding doing a radio show AND DO AN F'ING SHOW!! More roasts.  But not roasts about a gay guy that has done nothing in life.  Stop the canned cackling laughter after each joke is said.  If the joke bombs ADMIT it. You have alot to change howard to make me and millions of others listeners again.  Good luck bro.

I don't mind the show when they talk pop culture, but the made up bits with the actors pretending to be caught in stupid situations is sooooooo lame.  If they had real talent they could pull a real radio show together.  Rich should save himself and start looking to get onto a higher profile show because he is great.  I'm pretty sure that Johnjay is retarded.  Carrie sounds like a yapping little dog that just annoys everyone.

The John Batchelor Show was THE most informative talk show for world events ON RADIO. ABC made a major mistake in cancelling his show. I used to listen to 77wabc at work from 8pm to 1am religiously Mon.-Fri. I now listen to cds again. You have lost a loyal listener

Stern has rebounded. He was boring for a few years, but this year has been great. The prank calls have never been better. Richard Christy is an idiot genius. The drama with Artie is fairly entertaining. Stern is the father of modern radio and nobody else comes close.

They are great!  Every other show in this town does stupid ass radio bits.  This is not a bit show.  It's just like sitting in a bar ****ting with your friends about chicks, sports and having fun.  I have been listening for 12 years and I don't plan on changing.  They bash husker fans because that's all you husker fans care about and you throw that in the face of every other person in the state.  There are others like me who hate the huskers, love it when they lose and can't wait to throw that in husker fans face.  There are other things to do and watch in this area than that football team.  When you put the NU flag above the US flag on your flagpole, then you have a problem.  Husker fans, get a life!

This hack changes his politics to re start his career.  Any republican who likes this guy take a listen to his comedy shows back in the 90's.  All he did was rip Reagan, republicans and there policies.  Now all of a sudden he is a right wing comic, is it because he really changed or is it because he saw and opportunity to revive his career and play to the right since they really have no mainstream entertainers prasing republican policies (I am not including country music cause I don't consider that mainstream).  Dennis Miller is just another hollywood faker who saw an opportunity to become relevant again by playing to the right.

John Batchelor is one of the best things to happen to radio in the post 9/11 world. Who knows how he gets all his information Whether it's current affairs or history, the man really is an amazing source of info. Half Iranian, he really understands the Middle East situation and what's been happening there. I'm surprised he isn't yet in syndication. He knew what Sadaam did with the WMDs and reported on it at least 2 1/2 years ago. Tune in Monday to Friday from 10:00 PM to 1:00 AM to hear some really amazing things from John and those whom he interviews.

Crazy how the same type of bits you hear on other shows make it on to Kidd's show. This is ok for some smaller markets that they are syndicated in, but not here in DFW. This show is definitely brought down by the fact they have to cater to smaller markets which makes this show in DFW, the bottom of the barrel muck.

I think The T-Man Show is one of the BEST morning show in The Bay Area right now. But, I have to amidt, I miss The Doghouse.

Good enough to fill some time.  Wish I could sample so other shows you guys talk about on her.  O and A get old quick just like Don and MIke did in DC.

If only there was a negative 1 option on this rating board! I don't what's worse, this  whiney FAKE boring FCC posterboy or the idiots that write his paycheck! This guy does not deserve any airtime, let alone take up a slot that was dominated by such a powerful comedic team like Elvis & JV. And how many times can he say Teri in one sentence I lost count! Doesn't he know his own co-host's name This is why Satellite radio is where it's at. T-Man or whatever your sorry weak name is, if you have any sense, you'll just go away and save the ears of Bay Area listeners before you inevitably eventually get canned anyways......

The show has grown up. Some people can't seem to understand that. Back at WAAF, AND WNEW they were drinking beer, partying, and never wanted to go home. In that time period you could also get away with a lot more! You could basically do almost anything, as long as you got the station ratings. They were just having fun, and didn't really worry what happened to them. Now they have lives, getting older, and actually care about they're radio career. The stunts are over for the most part. Now, we get great interviews, comedy bits thrown in, and the most cringe radio that they can possibly do. Even on satalite radio, LAWYERS are involved, people will file lawsuits over almost anything, which makes radio stunts, almost impossible. We live in different time, and the show is now different. Wnew were great times, you just have to learn to grow with the show. If you can't, then tune into something else. But, your not going to find anything that was even close to what they did on wnew.

If I can't have Marc Maron (who I still miss terribly) and the assorted brillance of Kent Jones, at Lionel makes me want to listen to Air America in the morning.

QUOTED FROM THE ROLLING STONE ABOUT GRANDPA STERN           If you thought his sidekicks were useless suck-ups before, get a load of them now. Robin compares him to Martin Luther King Jr. Artie says the main reason he wishes his father were still alive is so he could hear him on The Howard Stern Show. We're making history, he gushes.

Laura Ingraham is GREAT! She's intelligent, witty, gutsy, compassionate and passionate about her convictions and the topics she presents. It's the LEFT-wing nuts who don't get her.

1.0
It's clear to me from call-ins to Thom, Randi, Sam, etc. that AAR listeners are generally quite liberal and/or progressive, and crave the information that we don't get on the mainstream media.  Lionel's topic choices often don't meet those needs.  There are too many radio programs that cover unimportant or secondary issues.  We don't need another.  Personally, I greatly preferred Sam Seder, as I always felt he addressed the most important issues in a palatable and entertaining way.  Marc Maron was also a great morning show.  But I'm sure there are many people who could present more germane topics and who could be entertaining at the same time.

Total waste of time.  This is a guy who says people who use drugs should be in jail, not rehab, but when it's HIM doing the drugs, he should get rehab.  His show is losing ratings and stations across the country, and it's interesting to note that he got to his prominence by GIVING HIS SHOW away in the early days because no one wanted it.  He'll end up going the way Father Coughlin did.  Coughlin was a demagogue from the 1930's who had millions of listeners and was considered quite the political force in his day.

Too bad this program is only on Sunday mornings -7:00 to 10:00 AM and only in the listening range of WABC. The Station is 50,000 watts and covers a large listening area well beyond NYC. But the time scheduled means that many Church-going Christians miss out on part or all of this fine program. It is advertised as the longest running talk program on WABC, yet it isn't even worthy of an encore broadcast, let alone a syndication, in the minds of the program directors. Too bad. So many could benefit from such a program. Rabbi Joe (Petasnick) and Father Paul (Keenan) are a great team. They deal with a wide variety of topics, religious and non.

I gave him a chance and listened for a few days. It's painful to listen to this guy. Wild 94.9 is getting desperate to cover their screw up when they let Doghouse go. Cant even turn to the whole station anymore. Same music, same pattern and same mix since I start listening when Doghouse was still around. All bayarea radio sucks now. Bring back the Radio Kings, bring back the Doghouse, our bayerea radio savior.Subway......Eat Fresh!!!!

I did NOT buy my radio for Howard; I had my subscription long before he announced his move.  Still, I listen every day for at least part of the show.  Sure, there are bits that I find annoying, and that's when I flip the channel.  But there are still a lot of drive-off-the-side-of-the-road funny moments.  Would be worth the $12.95 alone.

Little boring.  Spends more time on his political views and whinning it all should be about me, than anything else.

John Mainelli was right, they need to get those balls back...

I'm not originally from the Bay Area, therefore, I understand why there are so many complaints about his show.  I think T-man is offensive, loud, and does what he wants.  It's about time.

I look forward to waking up to the Barsky Show every weekday morning. In fact, I pretty much stay tuned to WYSP all day long.  BK&V have a great chemistry and although they aren't necessarily the most hilarious, most shocking or most outrageous, they are consistently the most genuine. I moved back to Philly from Los Angeles 2 years ago and thought for sure I would miss Howard Stern after he moved to XM. Fortunately, Barsky moved back to Philly and began broadcasting his show here again about the same time. I find myself able to relate a lot to this guy... Many times, when Barsky starts talking about his experiences in high school or when he was a kid, it reminds me of my own life growing up in Philly. It's uncanny. Really. Hey, BKV - nice work!

I used to listen to Strawberry and Fay every morning but now that they have been replaced, I make it an effort not to tune in, in hopes that the low ratings will get him off the air!

Strawberry and Fay have been replaced by replaced by garbage. Wild 94.9 are loosing listeners and I am sure they ratings have been hurt by airing T-man. He may be great in Seattle but here in the Bay Area he sucks!

Funniest show on the dial.  Features the funniest stand up comics in the country in an interview format.  Good for plenty of laughs every day.  I don't know anyone on or off the radio that does more to support stand up comedians.  If you get a chance, go to a live Friends of the Bob and Tom Show Comedy Tour show.  Personalities on the show:  Tom runs the show, and is an anal jerk but he's still funny.  Bob is a beer drinking, cigarette smoking, sex obsessed co-host.  Kristi Lee is the big boob blond news babe, and Chick McGee is the funniest of the bunch as the bungling, ill prepared, sports reporter.  But what makes the show good is that they have so many great comics every day.  Usually there are at least 2-3 comedians in the studio.  Plus, numerous parodies and running gags.  Love the show.  It's the best!

Shannon Moore's show on KUDO is addicting!!! I am constantly laughing out loud wondering if I heard her right! She is supersmart and quick on her feet.

Because of my job I get to listen to talk radio all the time. I try to listen to a broad spectrum of programing so that I can understand both sides of an issue and thus Ive listened to many diferrent programs over the years. This show when it was on in Boston was far and away one of the most comprehensive, informative and entertaining of any I've ever heard. I was just trying to find the show again to see if I could down load it some how when I discovered it was no longer being broadcast. I sure hope it comes back.

I listen to this show and laugh out loud... I must look like an idiot when I am driving in my car. Some of the smartest juvenile humor that you'll find.  The spontaneity of the show really makes it as good as it is.  For example, someone handed one of the guys a Nazi War Helmet.  The crew then walked and had a taxi hailing contest between a Nazi & a black guy... this was a great way to make a social commentary while entertaining the listener (the Nazi won). Comparing them to Howard Stern is absurd... O&A is real comedy, Howard's show is an out of touch old man who is trying too hard.

The Batcelor show was, quite simply, the best three hours on radio. Rather than cancel it, WABC should have fired the incompetent sales staff who could not find better advertisers than the usual collection of fake hair restorers, and loan sharks and spurious charities who paid the bills. It's a crime, or a sad commentary on the ****eoisie that a show of such high quality cannot find a place on the airwaves.

Enough of the Howard Stern fans repeating everything their King of All Media says on the air--Opie and Anthony are hands down the Pioneers of Satellite Radio.  First, Opie and Anthony's already fantastic show heads to XM as an uncensored show, then a few days later Howard Stern announces his plans to head to Sirius.  Then, Opie and Anthony finally are given their due respect to come back to Terrestrial Radio while Howard, on his own program mind you, says his agent has working to get him back on FM, only to backtrack on it the following day.  So now here's the question--who's really copying who  From what I can tell through Howard's actions, HE is the poser--NOT Opie and Anthony!  By the way, the Free FM half of this show is getting better and better with each passing weekday--give them time to put everything they want onto the air.  The third time's the charm, mty friend!

I've listened for about 10 years and have been witness to the gradual transition of the show. I feel that they have lost their edge and have become way too political. I realize that they have to fill 5+ hours a day but drinking the liberal kool-aid and goose stepping with the far left while acting like they are moderate gets old fast. It's like they wish they were the replacement for Air America. They are quick to call someone an idiot but quickly back down when confronted by that person. As they have matured the show has gotten more boring. They are number 1 in this area but that's easy to do with no competition. I've also noticed in the past few months that Tyler has developed an annoying habit of sniffing into the microphone when he stops talking. ON A POSITIVE NOTE they are very good interviewers and seem to make people feel at ease. The guys rightfully boast about how their bosses give them lots of leeway to talk freely and it's a shame to see that freedom go to waste. Trav rules!

Doesn't get better than the Doghouse.  I've listened to them in the SF Bay Area forever, and now I listen online.  Yes, they can be harsh at times, but you have to keep an open mind and remember these guys are having fun.  The Doghouse has a good mix of personalities, and the topics they discuss are interesting.  As always, they want feedback from the listeners, and this interaction with the listeners is what makes this show a success, while others fail.  Now if there is a way to get them back on SF radio, that would be the best.  - JT

This show has enough topical substance to make it interesting and enough fun stuff to keep it entertaining.  Barsky is the glue that holds the show together, Kim keeps the testosterone levels in check, but is FAR from stuffy and then there's Vinnie.  Vinnie is the star of the show, IMO.  I love hearing his no-holds-barred way of saying what the rest of us are usually thinking but would never have the balls (or ovaries lol) to say.  He's super personable, seems so accessible, and he's hotter than hell.  Have you heard this man sing  Amazing. I think Barsky's crowning achievement in radio was discovering Vinnie the Crumb.  I also love hearing Metro's comments on air from time to time.  What a great bunch of people.:)  Suffice it to say this 4 hour clubber is not going anywhere. ;)

Odd how those who disagree with Rush can only resort to calling him names referencing his weight or problems controling pain (not recreational use as so many of these opponents).

The truth hurts but as long as Rush is there you will hear it.

Mark, Kris, Ron & Teapot was the best morning show on the radio.  I now have to switch around to find something to listen too and it is hard to satisfy myself in the morning since I will not turn on 99.5 anymore. I will not listen to KANE at all and not 99.5 at all anymore.

I find most progressives interesting on the radio, much like some of the classes in college I fell asleep in. Lionel is great radio, off the cuff, able to follow a topic whereever it goes, well informed, and funny as hell.  It is not the same things repeated over and over again, like Seder. Radio is an entertainment medium, if you want diatribes and repeated facts, read a book.  This guy makes my day!

GENIUS  OH WELL THERE SUCCESS JUST SHOWS YOU THE TRUE WASTELAND OF RADIO ENTERTAINMENT THAT PROLIPHERATES THE AIRWAVES

The Howard Stern show used to be great. Since moving to Sirius, Stern started to show his edge again... Then he quickly floundered. And now he's becoming a vegan, promoting PETA activism, and overall gayity. He also shows hatred for American troops, unless they hate the war, in those cases, he'll put them on the air talk to them them with a seriously condescending tone. I've listened daily since the Billy West days... but not anymore. I do love Sirius though.

cookie cutter hack and says ho ho every 20 seconds, but not the bit! that's his laugh! it's either hah!., or hah. hah!., or hah.hah.hah!..

If you listen to 30 seconds of this show and can't spell, this show is not for you. Otherwise, it's the best show in the ny area, and right now they may be in danger of getting kicked off the air. In my opinion, jv and elvis make me crap up, like hanging out with the guys after work, and just goofing around, without using the negative tasteless humor that's supposed to be funny. And the show is pretty smart too. So take an honest listen.

It was a lot funnier in the old days when Donnie was there.  They've become obsessed with hating the huskers and the fans. You can hardly tune in without hearing this and it gets old ! Also, hearing them interview models for their calendar is as about as boring as it can get.  Go back to doing more  bits , songs, and pranks.  This is what got you where you are, not the prolonged political talk and obsessive husker hating.  I was a loyal listener, but have tuned elsewhere.

Great show.  Unlike TJMS, this show is consistently funny.  Everyone fits well and the humor just seems to come naturally to Tommy and Steve.  It can be informative and opinionated without being condescending unlike some others.  Great selection of music.  The only knock on the show would be that it caters too much to women and comes across as a male bashing show every once in a while...and please don't call Steve and try to point this out.  Other Idol and Sister O'Dell are my favorite parts of the show.  They do good interviews.  Not afraid to ask the tough question and not a bunch of suckups.  Shirley has the most pleasant sounding voice on radio.

Their different, not the same got to be nice radio or a show with a women their just so they don't get in trouble for rude jokes. They are for an aquired taste, but just because you don't: understand, think it's funny, offensive; doesn't mean it sucks, its just not your thing. They try to lighten up on other serious topics and make you laugh at stuff outside the normal realm of funny. Sometimes its a hit or miss, but at least they put an attempt at it. Also its not scriped like all the other shows, so alot of the times they go off on tangents and miss or run out of time on stuff they want to talk about.

Worst show on Big Sports 590. No professionalism whatsoever. Constantly bashes U of Nebraska sports, regardless of the circumstances. Thinks he is ALWAYS right and will never listen to other peoples point of view. Can't take any criticism or he will cut you off. Its funny how he has about a 50% rating on this ratings site, and nobody I know can stand his show, yet 99% of his callers agree with everything he says. The only people he lets on his show who disagree with his views, are idiots with crazy ideas, so he can make them look bad. He NEVER, EVER, lets a smart, articulate person on, either as a caller or as a guest, who disagrees with him.

I can listen for about 10 seconds at a time while surfing.  They think they are cutting edge with their dead air philosophy.  The show is horrible.  I'm amazed it's still on.  It lasted about 3 months in Austin.  I think Russ had illusions about going nationwide and being like his Daddy Stern.

Holy Smoke, people! The Mark and Kris show blew so hard I can't even begin to tell you. Kris would laugh at absolutely any stupid thing Mark said.

I did try listening to the Kane show, but the station has extremely annoying reverb that I couldn't bring myself to listen to it anymore. I'm happy to say that 99.5 is not longer in my preset.

It's basically the same show as it was back in 1990. Very one sided utopic opinions without deep thought behind them.

Very intelligent for people who already have the same arrogant, stubborn opinions. This guy has caught onto this act that is very easy to sell, and is a cash cow. Guys like these are adding fuel to the fire of discontempt for the country, and I dont think he cares about that, as he has millions to come home to, so why mess with the formula.

Sure, it was controversial, but it was fun. Then, when they got fired Strawberry and Fay were an okay replacement. Why did they leave Does anyone know Every time I get into my car early in the AM for work and I hear his voice -- it haunts me. The topics he discusses are lame and boring. His voice is horrible. His co hosts are just as bad as him, if not worse. Take this guy off the air! Bring back the pranks, humor, and flavor that we, people of the wonderful bay area have grown to love and appreciate!!

Preston, Steve, and the gang are hilarious! I listen in the morning on my drive and pop in a CD of their podcast for the drive home. They always have entertaining segments such as Music News, topical chat, contests, great celebrity interviews, Hollywood Trash, Month of Stunts, and many more. Steve's comedy is very quick and imaginative - he is a very large part of the show. Casey Boy just throws it all out there for the audience - nothing in his life is off-limits. Nick adds a lot to the show and also is the master of P&S's web site content... and you can also find videos and movies on Comcast On-Demand. They are the best morning radio show I have ever listened to - and I'm a fan for life!!

Great show with many angles and oppinions expressed by the host and they do not hesitate to let listeners voice their indifferences as well.  Good open forum for callers or emailers.

100% laughs. Russ Rollins is the master of the bit. Backed up by Dirty Jim, Blackbean and Daniel, this is the best Morning radio in Orlando.

Two very talented individuals when they work together. I mean together, because the liberal views of one is overshadowed by the tolerance of the other. Unfortunately, the show has to be turned off by about 9:30. That's when the embarrassment to the white inbred race shows up to relieve them.

I can't even listen to this show for more then 5 minutes.  Stop copying Howard Stern and come up with original material.

This show is pretty funny, but definitely not as good as it once was.  Blackbean and Jeff Howell would have done some good for the show, but unfortunately they aren't around anymore.  At least Jeff Howell comes back from time to time.  Sometimes Russ gets annoying, but overall I like the show.  Bubba Wilson is a really funny guy, and some of his songs are actually pretty good.  If you don't like wrestling you won't like 60% of the conversation...

THE AWESOME DUO!  I loved this show, and I'm so happy they have a new gig, but I wish they were going to be staying in the D.C. area.  I'm sure the new guy would be mediocre if I had never heard the Mark&Kris show before...but after being an avid listener for years...and being part of the mess COMMUNITY...Kane is like a tv dinner after years of gourmet...  My teenage daughter and I used to be able to start our mornings laughing and always find something to talk about when we listend to the 'mess.'  Now we jump from one xm station to the next, and she sleeps...we miss our Hot duo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I HATED this show for the first week... I am now more addicted to this show than Stern (a 14 year loyal Stern fan).. Ferrall is a breath of fresh air, give it a chance and even if you do NOT know sports, this show f**ing rocks... I still love Howard and appreciate the chance he took on Scotty ... One of the best radio host's ever, just GIVE IT A CHANCE !!!

Never thought I'd say this, but they are better clean than they were dirty. Much like Opie and Anthony, they work great under the new guidlines.The old days of wild radio are gone, and shows that can't adapt are dead.These guys have done a great job of getting cleaned up, and keeping it interesting. My wife has even become an avid listener. They are in touch with their thinking side, not just doing fart jokes.

I think the entire Wild 94.9 show is great from morning till night!  I commute to the bay from modesto every day, and your station is highly entertaining.  T-Man you are sssiick!  But in a good way.  Your show adds much needed diversity to the program. And for those of you that think Jose Ms' mixes are weak, than you must be from somewhere other than the bay area...you don't know crap and you know what you can do with your opinion...

Having listened to NY radio since the sixties, I've heard Ingram, Jay Thomas, Bill St. James, Pat St. John, Howard and hundreds of other talented jocks. The Doghouse with JV and Elvis is talented, topical, creative and extremely funny. Without having to rely on a bunch of comedians telling them jokes to relay on the air this show can think on it's own. Talk radio is tough, especially in this city. FM talk is even tougher. The Doghouse brought a lot of fun back to New York radio.

Believe me when she took over for Joe, I sure was Blue. eh, get it  But she has grown on me.

Not that it matters since she is on the radio, but she's easy on the eyes too.  I ahve been listening to talk radio for years, and this is by far my favorite show in Anchorage right now.

I no longer listen to this station while he's talking.  I used to listen to the station on my morning drive every morning UNTIL this annnnnoying voice came on board.  I'll still switch through the stations and will only leave it there while a song is playing, however, AS SOON as that yuck-yuck, grate on your ears, voice returns, I switch to another station.  I think 94.9 really missed the mark when they hired this guy.  If he must stay, please - oh please - force him to use his real talking voice.  I cannot comment on the quality of the content of his show since I cannot listen long enough to know.

Not a show for those with a double digit IQ. He’s as real as it gets for talk radio. And, unlike most other hosts, he does allow discourse with opposing viewpoints. The reason he will fail is he’s too Lib for Right-Wingers and too Conservative for Libs. The country does not want a rational media voice, nor do media outlets – it’s simply not good for ratings. Controversy sells advertisers, Dennis will not. Too bad…

Smart people obviously do not and would not listen to this show for more then 30 seconds and know how stupid and mundane this show is (I realize this doesn't say a lot about myself but I wouldn't say I am a smart person.). Proud to say smarter then most commenting on this show. The JV and Elvis show is the worst show on the radio, all they do is repeat the same joke over and over again HO,HO,HO. Fools call in an degrade themselves to and JV and Elvis and have absolutely no idea or understanding of any of the topics they talk about...they best words to describe them are , Stupid, boring, whining, childish, annoying, babies, and I will never have to listen to their dumb ass drivel ever again....

Once was great and now it only a below average show. JV and Elvis really let them have it. I guess I will listen to JV and Elvis from now on.

I am Filipino and I have been listening to this show for over 10 years. They are a comedy show making fun of everything for the sake of being funny. That is why this show were #1 in bayarea radio for more than 10 years and continuing to acquire loyal fanbase in NY. Before you judge these guys you should know what these guys is all about. JV is married to a Korean woman and has helped alot of people of different races when they were in Bayarea working in a Urban Station which they dominated for over a decade. Best show ever!!! If you dont like the show and its content just change the station. Alot of people with different races enjoy this show.

Sterns' been on the air for 20+ years and i've never listened to him until he came to Sirius.  I did see his broadcast on the E network a few yrs ago but only occassionally.  Now that i can (and do) listen regularly, i think it's a great show.  It's new to me so I love it.  Those who've listened for yrs and yrs may think it's tired and boring.  If that's your thought then perhaps it should be you changing the station rather than howard changing his show...
1.0
The show is good but a bit too repetitive at times. Often they seem to resort to sex talk, bathroom humor and random, annoying banter because they didn't have time to plan their show. Also, I think they are a bit too taken with their own so called celebrity from long ago--especially since a lot of it is due to luck and coincidence. I also HATE HATE HATE Elvis's laugh. Every time he laughs I cringe. He needs to stop channeling the stereotypical jock and find a laugh that sounds a little less acquired. And do we ALWAYS have to talk about sex and having sex Actually I think Zan is the only one on the show I could stand hanging out with, since he's fun and goofy without being obnoxious and constantly vying for attention. Please expand your horizons, format and dicussions! Thanks!

The show has been horrible ever since jim norton came along. They became popular without him, and dragged the unfunny dork on for some reason. Unfortunately there are enough people that like the raping kids, and bashing chicks, and tranny banging talk, and same old predictable jokes with the aids and dying, and dummy talk. not for me anymore. used to be a big fan until 2000 maybe 2001.

When you look at the history of NYC radio you will see that Imus had his day in the sun, Then Howie took over. Now that the sun has set on howie, The sun is shineing on Opie and Anthony. Howie just needs to come to terms with that.

So disapointing.  After all the hype, where's the great show  What a let down! He used to be so great, this is sad.  I would feel bad, but he's getting an awful lot of money for this, so he should be at least trying a little harder.  It's one thing say you'll change radio for months, it's something els to actually do it.  When does he change anything  Same old stuff, big new price tag.  He's a gifted salesman, but you have to back it up with something eventually.  Sad.

Like many of the other listeners rating this show, I used to listen to Strawberry and Fay on 94.9 in the mornings, but after the T-man show started, I stopped tuning in. Everytime I accidentally go to 94.9 in the morning and hear T-Man's annoying voice, I shudder and turn away as quickly as possible. Sarah and No-name on Alice are so much better than T-man. Bring back Strawberry and Fay!!!

The fact that most ratings are either 1 or 5 says it all. Redneck gorilla's with an IQ of less than 50 love this show - because its presented by one of their own. The rest of the human race just shudder and turn the dial...

The big show is great, but Matt as a host, is not. Travis Justice, or someone with credentials should take over Matt's spot. Its too much of a waste for that big of a signal to just give it to a Jim Rome wannabe. Count how many times Matt doesn't even mention sports on the show. But why would anybody let Journal Broadcast employees rate Matt's show There'd be a lot less negative reviews if you banned them. I loved Matt, but I love my career more.

This guy is the absolute WORST!!! I used to listen to this station every morning, the DOG House made my day, but this guy SUCKS! I would rather listen to nails on a chalk board then listen to his voice. The person who is responsible for hiring him should be fired along with him!!

Boring dead air.  Russ sits around twiddling his thumbs, thinking of things to say.  When he finally does, his yes men laugh incessantly.  The show is unfocused and he never addresses the audience.  He'll interrupt JD Ryan's newsbriefs to talk about whatever irrelevant thought comes to mind.  Most of his talk revolves around his personal life, his underpaid salary, & fart jokes.

I really have never heard anything so bad in my life. I had heard drew in 104.1, and he had a good show, but this fiasco just sucks. They are just not funny, not entertaining, nor can you learn anything new. I just don't get it. Seems like a waste of money to me.

I have never heard such a whining, annoying duo on the radio before.  Their whole show revolves around Anthony and that little angry Jimmy putting down EVERYTHING.  This negative commentary gets old FAST!  Opie pretty much adds nothing except the occasional one liner (which usually bombs).  What is all the hype about  Sidenote:  How pissed are the XM subscribers now that O&A are on Free FM until 9 (and possibly soon to be 10).  They rip into Stern for being a sell-out...for being irrelevant...for being hypocritical...etc...However, O&A sold out by going back to Free FM (after failing to make an impact at XM)...O&A CONSTANTLY talk about Howard Stern (Stern seems to be pretty relevant to them)...This duo is definitely a case where the hype does not match the talent.

Funny sometimes. Sometimes very repetitive and annoying. I used to listen to el cucuy not long ago. Not for intellectual audiences. Mostly for the masses out there who get their news from a spanish radio personality. Hopefully everything he says he does for the community is true and the giveaways also concerns me as an audience to give him the benefit of the doubt in exchange of ratings. Worth listening once in a while.

Perrault is not made of the stuff that makes for interesting dialogue.  He is sensitive and immature and it shows everytime he is challenged by callers.  When he initially arrived in Omaha it appeared a new and fresh un-biased voice had arrived.  However, it didn't take him long to ignorantly begin to rattle the cages of the Husker faithful with his disrespect way and hence bring his reputation (deservingly) to that of a Husker hater.  He would marry Dana Altman upon request.  The sooner this east coast freak gets sent packing the better.  Omaha doesn't want another Big Red Homer.  By the same token, Omaha doesn't want a Husker hater.  Bridges are burned and Sker Nation has a long memory.  Polish up the resume' homey!

I listened to Howard on free FM for many years before he left for Sirius.  I just got Sirius for free with my new truck and have just been able to again listen to Howard.  HIS SHOW SUCKS.

I used to be a HUGE fan of Howard Stern, but his days have been numbered since the late 80's and most of the 90's.  When he made the switch to Sirius, he should've dropped Robin--she brings NOTHING to the program now that it is uncensored!  Howard himself has become too paranoid about certain other talk show hosts, he babbles about things nobody really cares about, and its only the characters (besides Robin) that bring laughs for his show.  Besides--ever noticed how his audience hasn't been subscribing to Sirius  He is overpaid and overrated, ladies and gentlemen--stop listening to his crappola and go get yourself an XM (or find a friend with an XM online account to check out fresher talk radio show hosts.)

Never liked them from the beginning because they never brought anything interesting to the listeners. I think Kane Show is much more interesting.

Only thing they can do is do stupid stunts and expect people to listen to their stupidity. Good riddance!

I used to listen to it all the time.  Since they changed and went to KISW it is just not the same anymore.  The other thing that I don't like is that they put Tom Lykis in the middle of the night. If they put talk (not rock talk) on during the day and rock during the night it would help.  Since the enligtened Entercom company F'ed everything up I just don't ever listen anymore.  With one less listener means that much more loss in the Arbitron ratings and less advertising revenue.   TheHeebrewHammer (SSUC member name)

I tuned in to gain insight on how to debate my friends - I was hoping AAR would take the higher road and have a forum consistent with honest debate and insightful viewpoints. Its very frustrating to be shown facts and I have no response other than emotional platitudes and slogan speech. I have to research myself, of course, but I sense AAR is a cheering section rather than an informative and insightful program.

Offers none of this revolutionary radio that he promised for 14 months.  All he did was complain about fcc restraints and now that they don't affect him is show is still bad, just a few curses here or there and him searching for other things to complain about while those around him stroke his ego and tell him how great he is.  Save your money.  Very disappointing.

It was a fresh new start for Orlando radio than Drew sold out. Mel was a pleasant person to listen to at 7AM.The 3 of you blended together nicely.I am sorry to say that the addition of Savanah lowered the standard of the show to equal your competitor. Drew, friends are friends and business is business, you not only sold out us but in the long run you sold out yourself.

Matt Perrault is unprofessional.  This isn't college campus radio.  This is mainstream sports, we need someone open-minded with quick wit and a desire to inspire.  Matt is self centered and oblivious to what is good for his show versus what feels good to him personally.  There are plenty of candidates that would bring a better show to Omaha.  Time for new blood!

I used to listen when I was 13. After many years I tried to give his new show on Sirius a shot. All he does is drone on and on. Losing Jackie I believe hurt him a lot too, Artie can't handle the job. It's not the same Howard Stern show of the early 90's.

For being a nationally aired, syndicated show, I personally don't believe that there's anything really unique about them other than a funny sounding name. I find some of their bits humorous, however, I can't say that I would want to listen to them daily or for the entire length of their show. They're pretty good at doing mindless, bad-mouthing to people, but unless you're into that kind of ignorant humor, this show isn't very attractive.

Listened to Howard for many years and he is getting stale. I have both XM and Sirius and prefer Opie and Anthony hands down. And so does my wife. And both of us are as old as Howard. Although Howard can be entertaining, I think Sirius way over paid for his contribution to their network.

I used to listen everyday around the time Howard came back to Dallas. His show soon got old and was just the same topic everyday. I bought Sirius in January 05 and find it hard to listen to terrestrial radio and the 20 minute+ commercial breaks.

I used to listen to Stern and thought he was funny. That was until I discovered the real talents in radio: Opie and Anthony about 5 years ago. A lot of these stern fans are just sheep and go off of what he says. I DARE any stern fan to listen to O and A for just a few days and you'll be hooked and will NEVER look back. Trust me i've done it to a lot of friends and they all jumped over to XM for O and A. Stern's days are over... sorry people. Every day is the same damn format and there is NO new talent brought to the show at all. People farting, trying to get strippers naked repeat, repeat, repeat. Just awful.

I listened to this radio station since 1992 until the T-Man show aired.  This guy is ANNOYING.  I thought it was just me who could not stand his fake radio voice and the mmmm hmmmmm that he says after every sentence.  Not just that, but the whats up with the blue dot  I respect radio personalities more when I can meet them and see them because it gives you more of a familiar vibe when you listen to them.  The Doghouse was byfar the best.  This radio station has gone downhill since they left and although they hate to admit it, people just don't care about the morning show anymore.  ClearChannel should put their ego's aside and give the people what they want!  Down with fake voice, going to the bathroom sounding TMan and bring back the DogHousE!!!! WHAT!

You could say he was great in the 80s and maybe even in the early 90s but Howard lost something along the way.  O&A, Ron & Fez, etc...are the future of radio.  Face it when was the last time Howard invented something new  Even his hardcore fans know that he's just not what he used to be like a long time ago.  His program is just not shocking anymore.  If he really wanted to improve his show he would hire younger writers and producers.  After a being on the air for years and being successful he needs to reinvent what he once had, but I don't think he will succeed.  To Howard today it's all about the money and not about his fans.

His interviews with Dana Almantan might as well be done from the coach's chair, because Matt spends all him time up his rear.  I also cannot stand how he pronounces the word Creighton, and some of his opinions are downright idotic.  Arkansas hiring Dana Altman a bigger story than the firing of Frank Solich  The NBA could work in Omaha  And his producer should have one of those dentist suction tools on hand to dump out whatever is causing him to have that lisp.

Howard was absolutely brilliant and some amazing radio came out of the 80's and 90's.  But with shows like the Opie and Anthony show and Ron and Fez, Howard doesnt even compare to these shows.  Ron and Fez is my favorite. Ron is brilliant with his lightning fast wit and Fez is, well Fez.  Howard Stern was great and used to be my favorite but no more.  Ron and Fez on XM 202 are now the tops for me.

Was good for a while, but every Stern show is basically like every other Stern show (What are you wearing)  Ugh.  Was much better with Jackie and especially Billy West.  It was surprising at first not to see more ratings of 2-4 points, but I suppose the Stern show is something most people either love or hate.  It's moot for me anyway, I switched from Sirius to XM.

I have to say this... I laughed every morning when Strawberry and Fay were on.  When T-man came on the show I thought... wow... he's annoying.  Even though I don't tune my radio to his show in the mornings I still get the horrible surprise of his voice on a commercial during someone else's time slot!! The show no longer appeals to a lot of people in their 20's and 30's.  His style of talk radio reminde me of Rush Limba (spelling)  which my dad listens to.  Seriously  Wild 94.9 has hip hop music... why is he on there  Strawberry and Fay were the best 94.9 had to offer.  They made my commute to work amazing and I never wanted to get out of my car!

Nothing but a talking head, has show time and again that he can twist the truth any way he wants, has actually done it for demonstration I think. More concerned about his and his friends money

One of the few half-decent talk shows in the DFW market.  But be prepapred for lots of dead air, mostly intentional, and a host with ADD who thinks he big time.  He's more of an overpaid, butt-kissed, redneck.  His yes-man sidekick JD is a good guy, despite his brown nose.  The show is mostly a series of commercials interrupted by occasional talk.  Give me my Sirius Radio any day of the week!

These guys have been on in Cleveland for a while now and I can not believe how much they  suck. Skits: not funny; songs/parodies: not funny; and to top it off, the fake laughter they play at the push of a button is very annoying. Just glad that a good radio show(rover's morning glory) is on here.

I decided to give this show a chance after the doghouse left....oh man was that ever a mistake. He hired 2 nothings to laugh at whatever he says, it only makes the show more irratating to listen to.

This rating would have been higher if I had a time machine and Stern didn't become a whiny **** parody of himself. In Private Parts he cried about Imus keeping him down. What a hypocrite he has become!! I guess we only like gag orders when they benefit us, huh Howie

Howard in the old days was untouchable. CLASSIC bits came from him, he was an amazing, amazing radio host. This on the other hand isn't Howard. I don't know what happened to him and why he is losing his talent, but I want the old howie back!

This Show Sucks!!! I mean it. I tired to give this guy a shot but man he sucks. Michael Martin your a F**KING idiot for letting the doghouse go. You sucked as a PD and you suck at whatever it is you think you do know. your playlist sucks and your mixers do too, and the goods ones are burnt out and don't give it their best anymore, and why should they. You have Jazzy Jim as PD, Leslie Perez,and weak ass Jose Melendez running the mixshows. What are you people doing. Bring back good radio, bring back creative freedom in the mixshows. Bring back the doghouse and start Reppin the Bay again. Not all of us Go Dumb,get hyphy or thizz. Truth is these fly by night movements don't bring in the dollars you clowns need to stay in Business. Quit splitting the kids, blacks on KMEL, latins on Wild, everyone else get in where you fit it. Cheap Channel Needs to stop trying to own every station in the bay, cause we as consumers will breakaway from radio and find new ave's of media.CAN'T GO DUMB FOREVER

UGH!  This show makes me feel ill.  They are some of the most boring people I've ever heard on the radio and all they do is talk about themselves if they aren't doing another lame bit.

I've been trying to like them for about 4 months, and for a while I was really into it. But man did the bottom fall out. I can forgive a few fakitries here and there, but lately they added up to something that showed why they only made it in one, *very biased* market that they obviously put a huge amount of effort in pandering to. They can never survive outside of the bay area.

These guys are so lame and tacky its not even funny. Its the same crap day in and day out and they steal bits from other radio shows all the time. If you like these guys your either a complete retard or are probably the corniest person alive.

I heard Lionel a few weeks ago ask the open question What will you tell your child about this  (Iraq) war  Some poor guy calls in and says I'll tell him it was for oil. Lionel hangs up and berates the guy for not being expository enough.  He is drek!  And I wish he would stop voting for himself on this site. Praying for seder's quick return. Ronito6, Osaka, Japan

Insults people who don't agree with him or understand what he's trying to say. Misunderstands what callers are trying to say sometimes and insults them/hangs up on them. Seems to think that the only people who are capable of critical thinking are the people who agree with him. Doesn't go in depth about political issues, even though he's on a political talk station.

I was a big fan of the Cane show until today. It was simply despicable, juvenile and insensitive the way they talked about the 2 year old girl with 8 limbs that had undergone surgery. You people not only insulted her but you insulted all the kids and their parents with similar conditions. I am sure you wouldnt call it gross and make fun of it, if you had a sibling or child with a similar condition. Hell if I were an advertiser I would never want to associate myself with a show like that. The Kane show can go to hell for all I care, coz I aint gonna be tuning into the Kane show no more!!!!!!!!!!!!

I had heard about this show so I listened to it for about a week for a study on talk radio for school. Having given it the benifit of the doubt I must say this show is a big let down, the comedy is weak and the shows host seems to try to hard to seem hip/young rather than deliver the entertainment value. Having studied one of Drews competitors similar style of radio called the monsters ( or something like that) I have to say the monsters were 10 times better. Bottom line you want better comedy, and more entetainment value tune into 104.1 instead.

haven't enjoyed the show since they have been on satellite. I was a fan when they were on in the afternoon in Philly but there has been something missing since they got fired. the first 3 weeks were some of the worst radio I have ever heard and I was paying $14 a month for it. after my year sub was up, I didn't sign back up.

I liked Drew on 104.1, but this new show is just crap.  It comes off as an unorganized mess, and Drew hangs up on people for little to no reason at all.  I never did like Savannah, on 104.1 or 105.9, and I think she is even more out of place on 105.9...  I used to listen to this show for a month or so, but never got in to it.  I have moved on to more entertaining shows.

Been a Howard fan since the 1980's when he was the afternoon guy on WNBC. Followed him to 92.3 and now to Sirius. Bought all his tapes and went to see his movie. Used to love him, but now he works 4 days a week, takes off 16 weeks each year, no scripted bits, increasing commercial time. Same boring topics and show everyday. They pick on Gary one day, Ronnie one day, Sal the next day. Plus the show has turned completely homo. Howard is giving minimum effort for his 500 million. The only thing that is keeping me from cancelling my subscription is Arty and the phone pranks of Sal and Richard. Sorry Howard, I love you man; but something is missing here.

The show just totally Blows, why are all his topics about relationship problems I could care less about somebody else's dating issues. Who gives a damn. I give this show 1 more year and he will be fired. This is not his market.

This show has become so unlistenable since it came back last spring. I was a huge fan when o and a were underdogs, and didnt have the huge heads they have now, especially opie, who tries to put a little angryness in his voice whenever he talks, and never says anything funny. Anthony is genuinly a funny guy with a great personality. And Jim norton is probably one of the most unlistenable personalities and voices around. his predictable humor with his gagging sounds, and silly gooses, and sirs, and yichs, and wishing everyone fell into a puddle of AIDS was never funny to me. i guess its and aquired taste, just like dice clay or someone like that. this cringe humor is moronic, weak, and unintelligent. it's just negative ramblings.  the guy is an untalented leach. so o and a, dump norton, become a little more humble, and stop overly trying to shock. unfortunately, there is no other casual/comedy talk show to compete anymore.  ps, give jv and elvis afternoon drivetime.

Chad Dukes is entertaining to listen to.  He's very expressive and that really comes through on the radio.  I just don't like the fake, made up stories.  You can always tell when they're making up a scenario to give themselves something to talk about for an hour.  They should stick with the caller games and the top 5 lists, and limit some of the pretend life drama until they get enough experience to be able to pull that off.  Oh, and quit stealing quotes and stories from Rome.

His voice creeps me out.  He is annoying.  I don't listen to 94.9 now because of this show.  Even when I tried with all my might to give the show a chance, his voice alone sent me to another station.  TMAN: why don't you take a step away from the freaking microphone and remember that it works and we are not deaf!!!!  But besides that, in the 5 minutes that I managed to bear with the show, I saw that his content was very lackluster.

Matt is biased.  All subject matter concerning the University of Nebraska is negative in nature.  All subject matter concerning Creighton is positive.  Dana Altman is always referred to as Coach or Dana.  Bill Callahan is never referred to with any respect.  He is continually referred to as just Callahan.  Where is the word Coach  Steve Pederson is continually attacked.  I would agree that neither Bill Callahan or Steve Pederson are perfect, but on the other hand I would suggest that they are worthy of some respect.  Being a Husker Hater in Nebraska will assure Matt of local love in Omaha by the CU basketball fans, but this is a big state and Nebraska football is the single most important sport.  I really don't think that commercially it is in the best interest of 590 to run off Husker listeners.

Awful. Give me satellite any day. Russ loves himself so much that he is not objective about what quality radio is. JD, his sidekick, is a nice person, but it's obvious his job is to laugh at Russ' unsophisticated humor. Scott the intern was the only funny thing on that show, and Russ got rid of him. To be his sidekick you can't have any talent, because he is extremely insecure. He bombed in Austin, but he will always be in Dallas because the guy who changes the oil in my car and the one who unclogs my crapper need something to listen to. He is king of the white trash, and he will always have a good place in DFW radio.
