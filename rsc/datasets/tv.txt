While the networks continue to produce mindless drivel, like America's Got Talent, or The OC, intelligent shows like Scrubs continue to get the cold shoulder.  It's a shame.  Scrubs is by far the smartest and funniest show on television right now.

James Spader's and WIlliam Shatner's charachters must have been separated at birth. They MAKE this show ... bth as screwed up as the other, and they feed on each other. Great chemistry between the actors. Wacky show ... original writing.

One of the best law shows on tv (when it was on).  I am a law student and greatly enjoyed it.  My husband and I are very disappointed that it is no longer on.  I second the opinion of taking off crappy shows like Nanny 911, etc.  Or sell it to someone else so we can watch it still.

I like to watch it because of the bad acting. It's like watching a satyre like scary movie or something. It is so poorly done that I don't think it's the actor fault...I mean, would any good director turn this suppose to be drama into such a comedy

A really charming trendy show stacked with talent.  Great observational writing.  Real emotions and energy.  Great characters.  If you can, watch it uncut.  Some of the shows were butchered (necessarily) for syndication broadcast.  Really loved this show and I hope they do finally agree to make a movie of it someday so we can see what has happened to the women 5 years later.

The amount of wit, intelligence, and hard work that Colbert and his crew put into his show is very evident. This is a high quality show and Comedy Central should thank their lucky stars that Jon Stewart and Colbert are elevating the station past the very funny but comparatively silliness of it's next most popular show; Southpark.

Wow, imagine that.  A doctor with an attitude.  This has to be a first on T.V.  Is there a bunch of 8th graders writing this crap

Lots of unnecessary gore.  Character development is very weak.  Plus, the basic premise is stupid - forensic crime lab guys don't go out and question witnesses and get into shoot-outs with bad guys.  They could have at least made the show a little realistic by partnering the crime scene guys with actual detectives.

Grey's Anatomy is THE best show ever, it has everything you wnat in a tv show, drama, comedy, romance, emotions, riveting storylines, amazing cliffhangers, intimate characters! What an awesome show, and it has another 4 Golden Globe nominations to prove it!

One of the best shows I have ever seen. Joss Whedon is a master at making great television. Only his former works, Buffy and Angel, are better IMO. Go see Serenity now!!!

This has always been my favorite show until this past season with the new girl who replaced Kate - I do not like the sophmoric, juvenile and sometimes nasty comments between her and Tony.  Last week she made a very dirty remark about the cat that came running out of the cat door at the victim's house that was totally uncalled for.  This is broadcast in the family hour and I would have been highly embarrassed if my your teenage son was sitting there watching it with me.  For that reason, I will not be watching it tonight.  Please try to clean up the language on that show.  You will lose a lot of viewers otherwise.  Don't ruin what could be a very enjoyable show to watch by stooping to such low and vulgar levels.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Once upon a time, ER was a strong 4 or even a 5. Today it is a shell of its former self and really should not return for a new season. A shame really, as the show still provides a great venue for some of its stars. Alas, the reason to watch has departed along with the original cast...

Do yourself a favor: go out and rent (or buy!) the first season of Arrested Development on DVD.  You may have seen an episode or two in passing--do yourself a favor and watch it from the beginning.  It's without a doubt the funniest American TV show since Seinfeld (and it may even be funnier).  There is no laugh track or catering to the audience: the show is genius.  I would list the show's cast and pick my favorite characters, but I can't.  This show's cast is TV's version of Murderers' Row: they are the 1927 Yankees.  Just when you think you've found your favorite character, you'll change your mind.  The third season debuts on Fox on September 19th at 8/7c.  Do yourself a favor and watch!  Not enough people watch this glorious show, which is a crime and a shame.  It's the reigning Emmy winner for Best Comedy Series.  Those Emmy people know what they're talking about!

First of all Ryan (Ben Mckenzie) is awsome both in the depth of his caracter and looks he is my favvvvv &lt;3, Seth (Adam Brody) wonderfully funny comic relief nerd, Marissa (Mischa Barton) complicated sexy social chair beholder, Summer (Rachel Bilson) pure genious when it comes to insults and wonderful with Seth! Sex, drugs, violence what else do you need Right Nope.. you missed two things friendship and love!!! Haha. I got you you stupid critics who say it sucks, that means you havn't gotten the point you idiots, The O.C. isn't just about sex, drugs and violence but the other stuff that comes with it! We all have to deal with this stuff.                                                 THE O.C. IS THE BEST SHOW EVER IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU MISSED THE POINT IF YOU DO ARE THE BEST TO!

The best show on the air. David Kelly is a genius! And the only person on television with the courage (and the clout) to stand up and condemn the current administration. The whole ensemble is extraordinary. The episode last night, with James Spader condemning the administration for lying and cheating, was not only excellent but sooooo necessary. Perhaps a few more people will begin to see the corruption more clearly. Inch by inch, day by day, Americans need to reclaim their country from this stupid uneducated idiot. And this show is helping. Thanks, David!

This is The X-Files meet CSI set in parallel dimension in the city of Washington DC.  She's a some sort of a genius doctor and he's an FBI agent who used to be an Army sniper.

This show happy to say is not indicative of the women I've known or dated, and eventually married. It just seems pretty sad that Hollywood needs to bring this show of women who can't find happiness in life to such a high level, and make the youth of our country think this is normal. It's no wonder the divorce rate in Hollywood is so high.

John Stewart and Bill Maher bring a different perspective to politics and other public events through brilliant sarcasm and satire.  The Colbert Report is just another lame Al Franken attempt to be humorous that fails.  The Colbert Report claims to be tongue in cheek, while still attempting to send a subliminal message that it is serious and factual about the people it is mocking.  In the 1960s and 1970s this would of been a show for the stoner crowd.  The Colbert Report is a loser and, in my opinion, indirectly hurts any credibility that John Stewart still maintains.

This is an awesome series that is thought provoking as well as intelligently entertaining. Everyone thinks about a nuclear attack, this show demonstrates what might happen in YOUR town.  Every history/civics class in high school should be watching it.  What an amazing forum for discussion!  I CANNOT wait for the 7 new episodes...but a full 3rd season would be even better.  I am encouraging everyone to watch Jericho, and will be buying the first season on DVD as soon as it is available.  Thanks CBS...don't screw it up by canceling it again.  Seriously, it was just peanuts last time, who knows what you'll get if you cancel again...elephant dung

Must see TV. Informative as well as funny. In my opinion if there is a week point it's the interviews. Sometimes I stop watching it at that point unless it's someone important. Also the shows a little weaker without Stephen Colbert, his new show is lame, he should have stayed with the daily show.

It was amazing to realize House is played by a Brit. he stays in charector, and although I love the nasty guy, I'd hate to find I had a doctor with that personality. The show is fascinating on a diagnostic/investigative level. A show that plays up to the audience instead of down to them.

Jon is an excellent host, and all the people complaining about how Jon is liberal, stop listening to everything O'Reilly tells you. Jon Stewart actually makes more jokes about Democrats than any other late night host. He interviews both the left and the right. Sometimes his jokes may seem more liberal but that's only because his audience is in the 18-24 range, and those people happen to be more liberal.

I never do these things, but had to. I just realized that I hadn't seen the show and wondered what's up. Did a search and saw it was cancelled, bummer....it was getting good. Here's the deal though.....I don't care if you like it or not, some of the ratings were ludicrous....especially the one that says liberals are morons and don't love their country. Take it from a Republican turned Independent, it's just that kind of statement and sentiment that is divisive. Like or don't like someone.....who cares, but stop the name calling and grow up!

Jericho is the first TV program on the three main networks that I have watched in a very long time.  Truth is, before Jericho, I never turned CBS on anymore.  Jericho is relevant to our time, (sadly), thought provoking as well as entertaining.  Never before have I had a TV program to cause me to literally 'sit on the edge of my seat and hold my breath'-repeatedly.  Fabulous cast, great acting, realistic and this show has unlimited potential.  Jericho fans have so many questions left unanswered-we need to know what happens to Jericho and six more episodes are not enough!!!  Come on CBS-what a platform you have-what dedicated viewers you have-I mean fan clubs-wow!!  Jericho fans are now 'attached' to the characters and this program, CBS help us to stay attached to you-keep Jericho going!!!!!!

This is one of the best TV shows ever on. Sure Star Trek was good but did it seem real outside the ship No way! This one was well done, high tech, the premise great, the humor on the mark, action, drama, morals, ethics, charm. the characters and actors were great, and I miss them. What Does Fox just play darts to decide what it shows Now, except for House Fox has nothing. Nada

Ray was a good sitcom because so many middle class Americans who are white can relate to this show's premise. No, under any circumstances can a fan tell me that this show was a classic. Ray is a solid sitcom but hardly a gem and hardly in the same league with classics such as 'Arrested Development,' 'Fraser' or 'Seinfeld.'

I'm enjoying seeing what it might be like for a woman to be president and to deal with the resentment of men who wish they were in her shoes. It's tough to deal in DC.  Her family life seems pretty real too, with interruption from the kids at very inopportune moments.  I like the way Mac seems decisive and emphasis is not placed on her having mood swings and making decision emotionally.  She is intelligent and perhaps naive as far as how politics can work and that's probably how a woman would be in that position.  I do think it's a little neat the way situations seem to resolve in the weekly segment.

This is by far one of the best shows in ABC's lineup. Excellent scripting and acting. Absolute crime that ABC has decided to cancel it, and with a cliff hanger to boot. I feel that this show has an opportunity to become another X-Files caliber series if ABC had given it a chance to grow.

Commander In Chief is the best new drama this season in my book. With Geena Davis and Donald Sutherland, what's not to like about it. Plus,its timeing was perfect with the end of The West Wing. Unfortunately, I don't think it will be back next season because of its ratings being lower than when it premiered. When it went away for 2 months, ABC should have just cancelled it because there is no way it can bounce back. People won't start watching again because what's the point if it won't be back next seaons!! ABC really mad A Bad Call on this one!!

Best new show of last season.  It was a total suprise that more people didn't stumble upon this gem.  I think many people like myself are gunshy to invest our time into a deep plot when there is such a high chance of the series being cut and the plot having no finish.  It would amount to reading a book and never finishing it.

A very underrated show.  James Spader and William Shatner do a fantasic job, there's a real chemistry between them, and they seem to delight in pushing one another.  Shatner is also wonderful in his role as a senior partner, once a brilliant lawyer and now gradually losing it - getting by on bluster and flashes of his old brilliance.

This is my favorite show.  Too bad I have class on Thursday nights and have to miss it.  I think the original far surpasses Miami and NY.  The only think I have negative to comment about it is the guy who plays Nick Stokes, he is so dull!  I think the producers should stick him in the lab and make Greg more of a lead.  Maybe if the producers cast a different actor to play Stokes it would help.

If anyone on the show should be replace, we may want to take a look at the writers. After all, they are the ones who write the lines all of the actors use, maybe the problem is not bad acting but bad writers. Take a look at what Hollywood had cranked out lately. Not an original idea in years, all movies of old T.V. shows and reality television. No it is not David's falt that he has crapy lines, I blame whoever is writing the lines. There is not an original bone left in any writer's body of material we see these days. I like the show alot, I just think that the writers need to put alittle more, POW in David's and the rest of the casts lines (stories).

I haven't seen this show in years and am proud to say I don't miss it at all. Reba is a pretty good actress, but this show simply isn't funny anymore and has always had a weak dominant theme.

It is too unbelievable. The crime sceene techs do everything from questioning to the arrest.  The women dress like ****s and the men all look like they are on dope.  I like the character Grisim.

To be frank I watched this show in its first and second seasons and felt on a good day it was a three star drama. In 2003 there was a competition between this show and a crime detective dramady 'Keen Eddy' on which show was going to be Fox's next hit series. Sadly enough, 'The OC' won out against Keen Eddie. The truth of the matter is critics hyped this teen drama like it was the greatest thing since Beverly Hill 90210 and it was just an average series. There can be no talk of 'The OC' program quality depeciating over the years becasue it was just an average show to begin with.

It's interesting how many people are claiming this to be a Hilary for President advertisement show.  One guy even talks about republicans evil and democrats save the day.  It's a TV show.  Your politics are blinding you or you haven't really watched the show and paid attention.  The lady president is an Independent and the Speaker of the House is her evil foe and he's a DEMOCRAT.

It is nice to know the story of how Clark Kent became Superman, but this show is way too dark for younger viewers.

The pity is that, while Geena Davis is perfectly believable as a President, the show as a whole is so utterly unbelievable as to be an embarrassment.  It can't seem to decide whether it is a drama, a soap opera or a sitcom.  It suffers mightily from comparison with The West Wing which, admittedly, is a bit long in the tooth.  But at least it makes a good faith effort at realism and tries to get its facts right-and doesn't ask us to believe, for example, that the President can intervene in a state death penalty case!

Not Everybody loves Raymond.  The only joke here is that the idea actually found its way onto the airwaves.  In other words it's just one joke less than a one joke program.  As with most sitcoms, it appeals to those with an intellectual development that was stopped at age 8.  Fortunately they did have the good sense to employ a laugh-track so that the audience will be signaled whenever something is broadcast that was intended to be funny. The program amounts to a scandalous waste of talent.

Occasionally funny, but most everything about the show is so mean-spirited, I'm amazed it's so popular. Kind of sad, really.

This show flew too close to the sun and its wings have since fallen off. Too many dead, but is he/she really plot lines. And they are too hot and cold with the quasi-Da Vinci plot line. Either go with it or not. Watch Lost. It's better.

Vapid, mindless, numbing.  Yes, there are some good looking women and men, the music is good and the photography is flashy.  But the stories never get beyond who's screwing who (literally and figuratively).  There's no originality, no depth, and nothing to hold your interest.  Don't waste your time on this dreck.

This show has had many Jump the Shark moments.  But when Sam blew away her ex at the end of this year's season premiere, I think the shark may have jumped out of the water and bit the series in the a**!  And what's with the new theme music  I could be in the garage and hear the old theme and know what time it was!

just stupid no good ideas and a waste of time  put more interesting shows on my tv instead of this.

After one season, it's already jumped the shark. Mystery upon mystery upon weird happening upon bizarre occurrance upon . . . I can't get myself to care anymore. And the characters are just profoundly dumb beyond belief.

this show is quite boring and irrelevant.

In season 1 it was great, original, ist time a show was presented in real time, season 2 interesting, we all wanted to know what was next with poor widower Jack, season 3 AHH we were just about to get tired of the same story, Season 4 Jack Bauer new love interest, Audrey brought the interest to season 4, Season 5 a great idea for the show President US the bad guy and Jack & Audrey couple made the audience attracted to the show again, but Season 6 is the same all Story, Jack the immortal, well I know he cant die but I hoped I was going to see a great plot as in season 5  too bad!)I like the show and I was giving the show another opportunity but after I heard Tony Almeida didnt like heaven and its back, its to much, not only Jack Bauer is immortal, but also his buddy! I like Carlos as an actor and also i liked the character, but he was dead come on! you dont need him to bring the attention bacK to the show, just have a nice plot and bring people alive back like Kim or Audrey. thats it

Yet another medical exampliner / crime show  *YAWN*    &lt;P&gt;There is nothing new here...  the characters are supposed to be quirky but there are frankly just annoying and boring.  If you want interesting characters and well-written stories, go with NCIS - it's the best of the forensics shows by far.

Lame sarcasm, poorly delivered.  I love the Daily Report with Jon Stewart, and really used to enjoy the little bits Colbert did.  Here we have him for a whole show and it sucks big.  I won't even watch 10 seconds.  It just came on again and I turned off the TV.  Then thought, this show is bound to be gone soon, why hasn't the network pulled the plug  That's the only thing funny here --Why is this lame show still on the air   Bring on something I can stomach. Hooray for him for getting the big bucks to go on for a season,  now let's move on.

Dumb show about NOTHING.  What have any of the actors done since this show went off the air.  Oh yea, one failed sitcom after another.  Should tell you something about those three individuals and their talent.  And Jerry  Thank God we don't see much of him anymore.  Annoying, egomaniac, jerk best describe Jerry Seinfeld.

This show is a propaganda-filled knockoff of The West Wing.  It is essentially a one hour ad for Hillary Clinton's 2008 Presidential Campaign.  It is also like a lame duck hybrid of The West Wing and The Brady Bunch.  It doesn't work.  I watched one episode before I realized it sucked.

I got some laughs out of it when it was fresh.  It just doesn't work in reruns, there's only so many times No soup for you! can be funny before it gets real old.

ER was once one of the best shows on TV, but the writing has gone downhill.  The past couple of seasons were really weak.  Time to call this show.

Commander and Chief is nothing more than liberal ideology and propaganda, sprinkled with political correctness and liberalistic ideals. This show is horrible beyond comprehension. Should be renamed Vote for Hillary Clinton in 2008 Two thumbs way down!!!

Since the start of the fall 2006 season this show has gone way downhill. It used to be smart,quick with creative interactions which have now turned to stereotypical adolescent sexual banter.Previously I have watched each episode twice. Going to give Boston Legal one more episode before I drop it. would love to know the behind the scenes negotiations that turned a great show into a  ship of fools. Can't imagine BL keeping its fan base and lasting the year.

highly overrated, only mildly interesting. I don't see what people see in this show. It's watchable but not as good as people say

Used to rank a 5, but really gone downhill since Lake Bell and Rhona Mitra left. The Leftist-Hollywood slant has become so forced and Candice Bergen has to be the most over-rated hack of an 'actress' I have ever had the misfortune of viewing.

Is it just me, or does Caruso remind you of William Shatner and his bad acting It's like nails on the chalkboard when he goes into hit 'bit'. How many times does he have to use the name of the person he's talking to in a conversation Well ......... Dave. it looks like we're going to have to ..... arrest you .... Dave. It's not looking too bright for you ........ Dave. *follow up with lowering of sunglasses and then hands on hips* Ugh ... the WORST of the CSI's.

It's not the best anything EVER...get over it.  It was an ok show while it was on.  It's done, let it go.  The reruns just hold up, it's not fresh or funny anymore.  It's was a show that was good because you didn't know what they would get into next.  Now that we know, it's not that funny, it's old.  Move on people, nothing to see here.

worst. show. ever. i tried watching an episode, and I had to turn it off after 10 minutes it was so bad. its not good drama, its just titilation. this will be something that people look back on in 10 years, laugh and say man, what were we thinking

Where do I start  Okay, I’ll keep it simple…just like the people that write this repugnant, mind numbing, thoughtless, hasn’t there been 100 other shows based on the same story line, no one can act on the show, CRAP.  I would rather fall face first in to my dogs AS* than watch 5 minutes of this garbage.  If you watch and like this show, there is something wrong with YOU!!!!

Absurd - and not at all in a good way. A hopeless mass of cliches and lame excuses for humor. The two leads are good (I HATE that Asian chick), but they'd have to work miracles to make up for the writing.  I've watched and waited for this pile of dullness to improve, but no dice. Real LCD stuff - for retards is right on the money.

George sleeping with Izzie, that was when you lost me, it made me feel sick and I dont want to look at them.  This is form a person that would tape every show and then watch it twice.  I would have given you a 5 but now I feel it a 2.
