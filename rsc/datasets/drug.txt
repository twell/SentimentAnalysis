I was put on Cymbalta for nerve pain which it has not helped.  I was not depressed at the time.  I started on 60mg, had severe nausea and headaches, then was moved to 30mg, the same thing, so then 20mg and from there went back up to 60mg.  It has been 4 months and I want to get off of it.  The Dr. gave me 30mg for a week and then is going to give me 20mg.  I hope this works!  I haven't been sleeping because of it!  Be careful before you start taking it, it is expensive and horrible to get off of!  Not to mention all the drug interactions!

I spend $56.05 on this medication per month it is killing me, I can not afford it!  I have been taking this medication since 11/06 I was just fine, but the past 2 months I have had sugary urine, bad mood swings and almost no period at all. I have gained 10 lbs i am miserable. On the 13th of July I am going to my Doctor to have blood work done and be taken off this pill.  I have been on so many contaceptives that I no longer know what to take. I have been looking at the Yaz, but I just hope it isn't as much as I pay per month and the side effects, please no more severe side effects.

So, I've been taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo for about a month & 1/2 now.  I'm the last set of blue pills in the second month. Yesterday, I had a HORRIBLE panic attack out of nowhere.  I've gone through panic attacks from time to time in my life, but nothing like this one.  Has anyone else experienced panic attacks from this drug or any other birth control pill&#63;

I have been on Lutera for a little over a month. It is effective, but I feel very bloated and my period never came (cramps did, but not my period) and I have had a lot of breast tenderness. I am going to stick with it for a while to see if things get better.... But over all it is not bad, but it is the first bc pill that I have taken so I have nothing to compare it to.... but I have not had any nausea or anything....well see.

I want to begin by saying I'm very appreciative for all of your honest reviews! They made me realize that some fatigue and pain during sex may have been from the Ring. I've been very tired lately and have periodic pain during sex that I'd never had before, also some loss of sex drive that I attributed to chronic fatigue! Anyway I will definitely reconsider this BC method, even though I had awesome light and short periods.. I Still sometimes forgot to put it in and take it out on the right day. And so my search continues for the right contraceptive! Good luck ladies.

No real side effects. Maybe slight increase in mood-swings. No weight-gain (though one size bra-cup increase, but thats ok) no nausea, lowered my stomach cramps a lot!

I've only been on YAZ for one week and my ****  are over flowing in my bras, and feel uncomfortable when I sleep on my side (I got up in the middle of the night for a bra).  I'm scared of rapid growth in my **** (hello cancer!) -a cup size more in one week at least.  Also, I am repeled (disgusted even) at my boyfriends sexual advances for the  first time ever.  I hope this goes away.  Also, I had an unquenchable thrist for the first few days.  This went away.

I'm personally very happy with this brand.  I have nothing to complain about it.  Recently my pharmacy gave me the generic brank of Ortho Tri Lo which is TriNessa.  That brand, was a killer.  I got mood swings, gained from 5-8 pounds, was very nauseaus.  I hated it.  I have switched back to Ortho Tri Lo.

I have not an emotional person and am a very optimistic happy person.  But, since starting this pill i have been really on edge, even blew up at a few people which i never do.  I am just like a ticking time bomb.  I broke out on one of my cheeks too, so long to this pill i wont take it any longer.

I used to take Ortho Evra (the patch) and I switched to Yaz due to the amount of cigarettes I smoke per day.  I love it. I've been on it for about 5 months and I've had no issues.  The first month I got some light stomach cramps after taking it, but if you read the booklet, that's normal.  It does help with acne, too. I've never had any issues with mood swings or severe PMS or PMDD, so I can't comment on how effective it is on this issue.  By far this is the best pill I've ever taken, and I've tried 4 different kinds before the patch.  I'm happy with it.  I take it as directed and have not had any pregnancy scare and my periods are regular.  As far as value, I'm a military spouse so all birth control is free.

I have been on this for 3 years - and works good once you overcome most side effects.  Be careful going on and off this drug - side affects are killer!

methadone is a very dangerous,misunderstood drug. While it can be useful to control pain, the dangers outweigh the benefits. I rated this like I did because my sister was prescribed methadone for pain and she died after taking her 4th dose. Because this drug is so misunderstood the death rate from methadone is rising across the United States. If you are going to start methadone for pain you had better make sure that you are monitored the first few days after beginning the methadone. And be careful as to what other medications you are taking. You could end up like my sister and go to sleep and never wake up.

For me, it stinks.  My experience with it hasn't been that long, but right from the get-go, it's been a royal pain.&lt;p&gt;After only three nights, I skipped a dose, and the next day could not even sleep--at all.  I spent over 40 hours with NO sleep whatsoever.  Then, the next problem was when they raised my dose from 5 mg to 10 mg, and I ended up with massive diarrhea and complete drowsiness for an entire day--the diarrhea was so bad, that I had absolutely NO control over it whatsoever.&lt;p&gt;Another problem was that I didn't sleep any better than before--I still woke up 5 hours later, not once getting more than that 5 hours at night.&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this drug can help some people, but for me, it's been a nightmare right from the very beginning.

Don't touch this drug! I gave it a shot for a few months. The first month or so was okay, abd then I started getting moodswings and gaining weight. After I stopped taking it, I continued to gain weight, become depressed, my **** got bigger, and my next period was over 3 weeks late. After doing a little online research, I found TONS of women who've had similar experiences. When I finally went to the doctor (NOT the one who had prescribed the drug) for a pregnancy test, the nurse told me that this drug can often really mess with your hormones.

I loved the ring for the first few months because I didn't have the mood swings that I experienced with the pill.  But then I started to experience the horrible burning sensation after sex... it was so painful that I stopped wanting sex at all.  I thought something was wrong with me or that I was allergic to my boyfriend's ****.  I had no idea that so many other women had experienced this as well... it was not a side effect listed in the literature.   I have stopped using the ring and I hope the painful sex goes away.  I am very disappointed that this side effect was not discussed with me as I would have discontinued the ring earlier.

I would say this is convenient if you use it a few times a year and it's a good price and very effective; however, I was prescribed it at 4 mg and stayed on it for three years.  It was great for the first two years and then it became my worse nightmare.  It began wearing off all the time and my anxiety sored.  I was in constant withdrawal.  I am now getting off it and it takes forever, makes me feel depressed (which I was never before), much more anxious then ever and sleep is scattered.  I would never have taken this drug if someone had told me about the  withdrawal and addictive nature.  It should actually be illegal.

The worse side effect with this drug is that it caused major sexual dysfunction with me. If you don't care about that element of it, then it's a relatively good antidepressant.

Was prescribed this med while in school over a year ago. I've had insomnia all my life! Not anymore. I can sleep through the night and feel well rested the next day. Works within 20 minutes on an empty stomach and or 1 hour on a full stomach. If I wake up in the middle of the night, I fall back to sleep easily. The only bad effect is that if I don't go to bed right after taking, I may hallucinate or get REAL hungry...or even fall asleep sitting up on the couch. Works great!

Only 0.025 micrograms of estrogen, whereas regular Tri Cyclin has 0.035.  If you have problems with lower dose estrogen (like Alesse, which is o nly 0.20) try this one: I handled it fine, whereas Alesse I had spotting and other problems.  Why can't they make birth control cheaper though&#63;&#63;!

I was on Ortho Lo about 2 years ago and I thought it was great! I recently went to the gyno to get back on bc and choose it again. I've been taking it almost a full month and I have noticed a big change in appetite. I stay hungry! My **** are extremely sore! I do have spotting in between periods. I just like it mainly b/c it doesn't make me feel nausea. All the others do. My sex drive hasn't changed of what I can notice. I've had more acne than usual. I'm still debating whether I should change to another pill or not.

I have been on a few bc pills over the yrs w/ very few side effects (other than getting pregnant while on Ortho Novum 777 years ago). This pill is nothing but side effects for me. I have had a few panic attacks out of the blue & the depression is terrible. I feel depressed all the time. I don't want to do anything. I burst into tears for no reason at all. I have never had cramping with my periods until I started taking this pill. My periods used to last two days and were very light. Now they last twice as long and they are heavier. I have had a lot of nausea with it too. I was on Aviane over a year ago with no problems. My doctor is switching me back to that as soon as I finish this pack. I won't take Lutera again. Even though Aviane & Lutera are supposed to be the same, my body reacted to them much differently.

I would like to post a warning on this site... My friend was recently hospitalized after discovering she had blood clots in her lungs.  The doctors told her that due to the Nuva Ring, many women have suffered severe blood clots, and since she was on the nuva ring, she suffered as well.  She is now ok, but cannot ever take contraceptives again.  DO YOUR RESEARCH! BE CAREFUL! The way in which hormones are distributed to your blood stream with Nuva Ring is totally different than Oral Contraceptives.

I am so glad i read this. I was worried that i had a brain tumor or something like that. I've been on Yaz for about 4 months, the first 2 months were ok but lately i've been having non-stop headaches,even migraines.They are so bad that i cant even sleep. I also lost my sex drive, i think the 1st or 2nd month i started. Im getting of Yaz immediately!!!

I took this for headaches. Maybe it is a good medication for other types of pain, but I found that it had very little effect when taken alone. I did find that I had some better results when taking it either with tylenol (ultracet) or a NSAID (usually indocin, Mobic, Volteran, or Daypro. I am assuming that the same would be true for ibuprofen)

Adderall Xr is great if you have to pay attention for long periods of time seeing as it lasts around 10 hours.  You get work done fast, enjoy the work you do, and put a greater amount of effort into what is required of you, all this for a relatively small amount of money.  Addiction is possible and dependence likely if Adderal Xr is used for an extended period of time consistently.  You will probably have trouble sleeping when you start using it.

I LOVE Ortho Tricyclin Lo. I tried 2 other pills, regular Ortho and Yasmin and both of them gave me horrible side effects (cramps, bleeding).

It was great at first - knocked me out in no time at all then it made me see some weird stuff!!! Then I did some weird stuff - even fell down the steps into the basement which I don't recall. I could have broke my neck!!! I was told about it the next day and had the black and blues to show for it. Finally 10mgs put me to sleep for 2 hrs only. 20mgs which I don't think I was supposed to take put me to sleep for 4 hours. Just started taking Rozerem which so far is working. I hope it continues to work for me.

Lunesta took longer to make me sleepy. When I finally got to sleep, I was able to remain asleep. However, in the morning I felt like I just did not get a good quality of sleep. The horrible taste in my mouth lasted throughout the day. I was throwing out food left and right thinking there was something wrong with it. Even brushing your teeth is a nasty experience. All foods tasted rotten. I only had samples, and I used this 3 times and went back to Ambien.

I have been on the NuvaRing for almost two years. I love the convenience of it! Insert once, leave it in for three weeks, then take out for a week. Repeat. You can take it out for up to three hours for sex too! I haven't experienced any side effects. This product totally underrated.

This is a wonderful drug for moderate anxiety. However, as with all wonderful drugs, there are dangers. I was on this med for about a year and a half, off and on. Started with .25 mg gradually ended up taking between 4-6 mg a day. Both times I stopped taking meds were horrible. Terrifying withdrawal symptoms. This is a good med to take for acute panic attacks, but not as an every day treatment.

I was given zoloft because I had crying fits after my boyfriend broke up with me, saying he never loved me after about 10 months. He did the same thing to me 6 months ago, then later said he realized he did love me, and then said it all the time. Hence, I was devastated when he told me it was all a lie. Zoloft actually made me worse. There was a weird, tingly feeling in the pit of my stomach. You know that feeling&#63; That tingly feeling is what you feel when someone breaks your heart and you feel sick. Well, the zoloft made it more pronounced and I couldn't get out of bed, couldn't stop crying, actually considered suicide. When the affects wore off the next day, I felt fine. I tried it one more time one day and then off the next. I am that percentage of people that cannot take it because it makes depression much worse. Now I guess I'll see if I can sell it or something.

I like this contraceptive.  I haven't had any side-effects.  Horrible pill pack though.  Sometimes it doesn't work very well for me.  My pills wind up flying everywhere and then my cat pounces on the it as if it were a fresh salmon.  The stupid cat thinks it's a great game now!  He sits there just waiting for me pop the pill out through the little hole in the pill case.  He's hoping that he'll have something to chase after.  Jeez, rolling eyes.  I just can't wait for the day that I have to call my vet to ask them what I should do since my crazy cat ate one of my birth control pills.

I've been taking ortho 2 months for acne and to help with my period. Now I just feel really numb and at times really depressed im not sure if it's just because of whats going on in my life but i feel like things got a lot worse since taking it. My acne has gotten worse on my chin and sides of face. I never feel hungry but i gained weight, maybe water weight. My **** are huge now and I feel pregnant because of such bad bloating. My eyes look sunken in, yeast infections, and during my period I dont sleep. No sex drive which makes me feel even more sad. My sister's 17 and has been taking it since she was 13 to regulate and she hasn't noticed any problems. My roommate took it and her skin cleared up right away, she complained about feeling really emotional though

Reliable. Nauseating 5 days of the first month. In the mood for the first 2 weeks of the first month. Very calm, sleeping very well. Gained 10lbs the first month. Hyper and emotionally sensative during my priod. Nauseating 3 days the second month. Not in the mood at all the second month. Sleeping 9hrs a night. I love it, but I don't feel completely rested once I'm awake. Gained 10lbs the second month. The weight doesn't bother me... clothes not fitting properly bothers me. I don't have extra money to buy myself a new wardrobe. I'm quitting because I'm tired of being tired, and I'd like to get back to enoying the idea of sex. Not even a healthy dose of literotica or**** turns me on anymore. Unless I only wanted to regulate your period, what's the point of being on this pill if I don't even want to have sex anyway&#63;

I suffered ever since I can remember from migraines,vomiting,severe pain on one side of my head,visual disturbances(blind spots and sparkling lights)Heightened hearing sensitivity, Zomig is a miracle cure for me even though it is expensive it is worth every penny I spend!! Instead of laying in a dark room for days on end with a pan for vomiting in I dissolve the tablet in my mouth and within 30 minutes I feel great! It does not impair your activities in the way that other narcotic pain pills do, so this is my answer for migraines!!! I would recommend them for anyone who has migraines as bad as I did! It sure makes me glad that I don't have to take those trips to the E.R. anymore for pain shots and all the jeers and comments I got from the doctors and nurses who thought I just came because I wanted to!!

I was given a prescription for Alesse, but I couldn't find a pharmacy that had it.  The first month I took Aviane, and other than some stomach upset the first day, it was great.  It helped get rid of my mood swings.  Then I sent my prescription to the mail order pharmacy to get a 3 month supply, and they sent me Lutera.  I agree that this is NOT the same drug.  I had all kinds of symptoms:  mood swings, excessive sleepiness, weight gain, especially in my ****, trouble concentrating, headaches and a weird feeling in my head like the top was going to come off!  Definitely not normal.  Now I'm stuck with another 2 months supply and I don't want to take it.  I'm afraid my insurance won't let me get any Aviane since I still have 2 months to go on the Lutera.  If I had known what kind of problem this was going to be, I wouldn't have used the other pharmacy.

I started taking this before I got married.

I was on Femcon for several months but it was costing me $40.00 a month so I asked my doctor if there was something else that was a little cheaper so he perscribed Balziva. I was on it for only a month and I couldnt take it anymore. I was an emotional wreck. I cried everyday. I kept comming up with these crazy thoughts, I was convinced that my husband was going to leave me and he didnt even do anything to make me suspect it. I have now switched to Yaz and things are going much better. I would prefer to pay more than to be a basket case on the cheaper pill. I didnt notice any weight gain like others mentioned but if someone were to ask me, I would say avoid Balziva.

I have had ADD since the age of 8 but never wanted to admit that I could be an adult w/ ADD. When my work began to suffer as well as my relationships, I realized that I never grew out of it, which is very difficult to admit. Adderall XR so far has been great. I took 10mg for 2 weeks & it did nothing. I now take 20mg & finally I can tell it is there. I'm still not sure if it is to the effectiveness I would like. I may bump up to 30mg. The side effects are so minimal. Dry mouth here & there, & a decreased appetite, my hearing is sensitive sometimes as well. This stuff is changing my life. I listen better, I can actually watch movies all the way through! I don't feel as overwhelmed, & can finally get work done. I don't get angry as easily, & now I finally feel like I'm happy again & can put my life in order & have control over myself. It is expensive even w/ my insurance, but well worth it!

I've been on Lutera for 8 months. I'm not preggers, so I suppose that is good. However, I have been extremely depressed for a long time, and I'm starting to realize that it may be from this drug. I've had problems before, but not to this extreme, and it started around the time I started to take this drug. I'm going to call my doctor and go back on Ortho Tri Cyclen. Other side effects for me were abdominal pain when I first started it (kind of like cramps but more constant), sluggishness, spotting, and my periods are more painful then when I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen. This stuff is not worth it. I think I'd rather have a baby.

I took Vicodin ES and Fiorinol w/Codeine for over 8 years for pain management.  I was finally referred to a pain specialist who prescibed me methadone and for the first time in 10 years I have been virtually pain free, with hardly any side effects (just the usual constipation, treated with Colace).  I am finally able to work full-time, finishing my MBA and living life with my family.  Methadone has gave me my life back.  I only have to take 2 10mg pills two times a day for effective relief 24 hours a day.  With my prior medications, I was bedridden, taking up to 10 pills a day with very short term effects for pain, not able to function, sedated and on a constant roller coaster.  I urge anyone  suffering with chronic pain should ask their pain management specialist about the benefits of methadone.  Even though many still link methadone with heroin addicts, they need to look at recent research how methadone has helped chronic pain patients gain their lives back.

since taking yaz for 6 months now i have been experiencing a strong case od pmdd. every month at that time i have become extremely depressed, for a couple days i will cry and want to die then once that time is over everything is fine. i have no improvement in periods, they are as terrible as ever, coming on the wrong days and heavy as ever. i want to die at that time of month, i get so depressed (and this never once happened off the pill, i never used to have any problems). i will be searching for a pill that regulates my moods far better.

I have had a problem with Lutera ever since I sarted it 4 months ago. The abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, foul smells and lots and lots of discharge. I had breakthrough bleeding for three months and the doctors had to check me to see if I was anaemic. I have a headache almost everyday and wake up every morning at 5 AM feeling icky. This pill is clearly NOT for me, and I am switching to the ring or the IUS.

It’s just another weak, synthetic opiate.  Ibuprofen works better for my headaches than this.  It’s really slow to start working.  I don’t understand why they made a painkiller with such a slow initial onset.  Why take a medication than can potentially cause seizures&#63;  Even under the 400mg per day there is a risk.  I won’t touch this stuff anymore.

BE WARNED! My wife is currently in the hospital, undergoing treatment for blood clots, resulting from this contraceptive. She had pains in her leg, which she dismissed as a hard work out. Next week her leg was swollen, and a horrible color. We admitted her through the E.R. and they diagnosed the problem as a DVT. They also found three smaller clots that had traveled to her lung. She would most certainly have died if we had not immediately gotten her medical care. The scary part is that her OB/GYN did NOT warn us of the potential problem.  As the other person said, this can be truly life threatening. PLEASE MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE!

I have only been on Lutera for a week now, and for the first few days I woke up in the middle of the night nauseous and had it in the morning but it wasn't anything TOO bad. I did notice some random crying over nothing major, but I just laughed about it--nothing too damaging. :) It is very affordable and I no longer wake up with nausea. Hopefully things stay good! My friends say I'm nuts, but I swear my **** already feel heavier!

Doesn't work worth a damn.  Not for me, or for anybody else that I know (who has tried stimulant medication in the past).  It seemed to work for the first month, but after that--nothing.  Literally nothing.  Might as well not have been taking anything at all.  Expensive too.

I became pregnant while taking tri-sprintec regularly and as prescribed.  I never missed pills and took it at the same time every day. I was on Ortho-tri-cyclen for several years, and then switched to tri-sprintec for insurance reasons. I had been on it for about 3 years when I got pregnant.

I just started my third pack of Yaz, and finally realized that maybe the recurring suicidal depression isn't a coincidence. I got on this pill to HELP with my moodiness, and now all I do is cry, eat, sleep, and scream. My skin isn't doing well, and light periods aren't going to do me a bit of good if the depression kills me. These suckers are going in the trash! And ladies, thank you so much for these reviews- I honestly thought I was losing my mind- it helps so much to know I'm not the only one.

I have a feeling that most of the ppl who rate this drug, experience horrible side effects, but where are all the ppl who have nothing but positive things to say&#63;  Well I've been on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo since Dec 06'.  The main reason I went on this was to clear my severe forehead acne.  I was going on a cruise in Feb and I wanted to make sure I would be picture perfect.  Anyhow, I started to notice that my skin was clearing up about 2months after I started.  I experienced a few mood swings here and there but not sure if it was due to the pill.  I also have not gained any weight.  I believe that if you do not change your diet, and you still exercise...you should be ok.  What's all this B.S. about weight gain&#63;  You gain weight because you EAT MORE.  The pill may cause your cravings to increase but that's controllable as well as your excercise regimen.

Works fine, was hoping to alternate with Ambien to fight off tolerance build-up.  However, the killer for me was the HORRIBLE taste in my mouth.  I tried Lunesta each night for about a week and the awful taste NEVER got better.  Cough drops, spicy foods, gum, breath spray...  nothing could defeat the bad taste.  I stopped taking it solely for that reason.

First 2 weeks had severe leg and stomach cramps and an elevated pulse rate.  Requested to be taken off but I then thought I should try a little longer as I have gone through most of the other types of blood pressure medicines with no results.  Glad I did because the symptons have disappeared.  Hopefully they won't return.  Best I have felt in a long time.  Blood pressure now 133/85 which is good for me.

I really love lexapro. It has worked wonders for panic attacks and anxiety. However it has killed my sex drive, which being newly engaged ...sucks! Recently my doctor has me taking 1/2 of my lexapro dose and 150mg of wellbutrin XL. Since then my sex drive has come back but so has some of my panic attacks. So I'm kind of at a loss. Hopefully with time things will change. If not I choose to stay on the Lexapro and find something else to help the sex drive. I do agree that withdrawal from Lexapro is hard. Mood swings are extreme.

Doctor represented this is the same as Aviane. It's not. Same side affects as OrthoTri. Terrible depression setting in, mood swings and fatigue. This pill obviously affects everyone differently, however if you had mood and depression problems while taking OrthTri or OrthoCyclene, then I suggest Aviane. Avoid Lutera.

Began taking Lexapro because other medications did not work on the combination depression and anxiety. I could feel that Lexapro 'took the edge off' within several days without me feeling high. I was delighted that FINALLY there was something that would actually help. I have been on it for at least two years and seem to be doing fine. I can't comment on the suicide thoughts or sex drive problems because I haven't had the thoughts and do not know if Lexapro is the reason for a lower sex drive.

I switched to Ortho Tri Cyclen LO to help with acne as well as to avoid painful cysts. (not to prevent pregnancy, so I can't give a review on the sex drive or related issues!) I started with extreme nausiousness that would wake me up in the middle of the night. I have had several anger outbursts and gotten REALLY mad over situations that didn't warrent so much anger, and I am usually very un-confrontational. After one of them I ended up crying uncontrollably. (also out of character.) I have also had an incredible appetite- haven't even been on it for a month yet and have gained 6 pounds. The worst part is that about the 2nd week the inside of my mouth had a metallic taste as if I had been chewing on tin foil! It has gradually increased from a wierd taste in my mouth to a raw, scratchy feeling that makes my mouth burn whenever I eat. Unfortunately, I haven't even seen a big difference in my acne.Not sure what I'm going to do now, but I'm not taking this $50 a month pill anymore.

I switched to OTC-Lo after having problems with an IUD.  We had decided not to have any more children, so the IUD was a great choice, but it was not compatible with my body.  My obstetrician gave me a year's supply that day, stating this pill was better than Loestrin (my requested pill) because it had a lower incidence of side effects.  Beware of all things free- I am now pregnant with my third child, and I can assure you that I took this pill with precision.  I also gained 10 lbs with the pill and had horrific mood swings. While we will welcome and love this child as we do our others, this failure has ensured that my husband and I will both pursue sterilization post-delivery.

Ultram is extremely addictive.  You will not hear this from a pharmacist or doctor, but believe me, it is.  I was taking it for a year for colitis.

I have been on Yaz for 5 months. So far I've had very few issues with the medication. I had severe PMDD prior to taking Yaz; however, now I have no symptoms - no cramping, bloating, irritability, emotional depression, or body image issues. I will admit to having a slightly decreased sex drive, but I have always had a very eager one so the benefits of decreased PMDD symptoms certainly outweigh the desire to have sex a bit less frequently. All people are different, especially women (since we are so hormonal), and every birth control will affect each individual differently. If you have moderate to severe PMDD, I would highly recommend this medication. I haven't experienced any weight gain, but I'm 33 and my weight has always been pretty steady at 107-110. I also suffered from adult acne several years ago before going on Acutane, and I haven't had any breakouts as a result of Yaz. To each is to own; if Yaz doesn't work for you, try another birth control until you have a good match!

I HATE this stuff. I only took it for about 10 nights to try and shift my sleeping pattern. After 10 nights I stopped and that night I DID NOT SLEEP AT ALL. And was incredibly HOT and my skin was HYPER SENSITIVE, and I could not get comfortable at all. The next day I felt HORRIBLE, and when I tried to take a nap I STILL could not sleep. That was today and I am hoping that it does not continue into tonight. I have read such horror stories today on the web of people going 40 hours straight without any sleep GOD I hope that doesn't happen. Some people might be able to take this med. but I am NOT one of them. BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS DRUG!!

I've been on Lutera for only 2 weeks now but It's pretty good. For the first 3 days I had an upset stomache and woke up at 5 in the morning vomiting... BUT i found that swallowing it with milk instead of water eliminated these side effects!! It's even cleared up my skin a bit so thats good :-). After reading these ratings I'm a little scared but I'm going to keep with it anyways. I haven't experienced any mood swings, changes in my sex drive, or weight gain/loss.

I've been taking Cipralex/Lexapro for close to a month now and am astonished at how it just takes the edge off, and at such a usually stressful time of the year for me.  I'm much brighter, less anxious, and have had NO thoughts of suicide (it was nearly a daily occurrence for me prior to starting these pills).  My husband even noticed a huge difference; I laugh more easily and don't brood like I did with my mood swings having pretty much disappeared.  The only problem I had was the initial dosage was too high and was quickly reduced as I thought I was going to die (talk about extra anxiety!); once I was switched down, I felt fine.  I would also like to emphasize that people (of any age) on any form of anti-depressants do their research as many doctors give out happy pills far too easily.  I was only prescribed these after other methods failed for me and after I agreed this pill might be suitable for me.

I LITERALLY gained 30 pounds since i started these 3 months ago and no matter what i do it sits there in my belly. Also my period is all ruined now and comes on the week before the white pills. Whatever you do, try some other ones before this one! And dont let your doctor convince you because there are others out there, you dont have to gain weight with the pill. yasmin is the best

This pill was horrible, I would wake up at 3am in the morning vomiting. I would feel nausiated and drink some water and throw it up. I would have stomach pains, and have the chills like having a fever. After I went to the bathroom I would feel better. I lost a pound a day throwing up my dinner. Now I'm on Microgestin Fe 1/20 for one day and so far so good. The bad symptoms were caused by the hormone Estrogen. I had the lowest dose possible of the hormone and if Microgestin doesnt work I'll have to take the shot Depro Vera every three months which only contains progestrogin.

I've been on this pill for three months and I hate it.  I take it at exactly the same time every day, I've never missed a single pill.  Yet I get extremely frequent break-through bleeding and spotting, sometimes so bad that I need to wear a tampon.  Its also given me really bad breast tenderness for the past month, and it makes me cry all the time!

As a painkiller it's cheap, works fast and has no really serious side effects.  It's so cheap that now they don't put it in PCA pumps anymore-they want to put other stuff like fentanyl in your PCA so they can bang your insurance for every penny!!  I have had Demerol in a PCA pump after major surgery and it worked great.  In pill form it works fast and the generic is as good as the name brand and dirt cheap!

I took this drug for 1.5 months and have gained 6 pounds.  I never gained weight on any other birth control pill and am extremely active.  No matter how many hours I exercise every day, I can't lose any weight - I just keep gaining.  Normally this amount of exercise totally peels off weight for me.  I used to take Alesse & was extremely satisfied with that.  The only reason I had to stop taking Alesse temporarily was because the pharmacies in town couldn't receive enough Alesse.  I finally got some Alesse, but the pharmasist suggested that I complete my current package of Ortho-Tri-Cyclen Lo before switching.  I am scared to continue.  I don't even feel like having sex because I feel awful about how I look and my clothes aren't fitting well.  So, I can't really say if this drug has been effective or not.  This weight gain has made me feel depressed and stressed out which has affected my sleep & so I feel tired all the time.  I never had these physical & emotional problems before.

This is the best antidepressant I have tried. I am on the generic at 50mg/day. Beginning it was typical - had some upset stomach and insomnia, which went away after a couple weeks.  I feel able to handle what is coming at me without spiraling into anxiety and then depression - it really helps me keep level about what is going on around me; I'm much less paranoid about what others think of me.  My family and friends agree that I am much less encumbered by anxiety when on this drug.  I will have to exercise a little more as I think it caused some slight weight gain.  Sex drive is lower, but not totally gone.  Will take as long as I can.  I did successfully go off this drug for two months but decided that life was too short to spend so much of it trying to get over the bad thoughts that kept brewing.

Before taking this drug I was a happy-go-lucky girl that loved having a great time, with no depression whatsoever. I have been taking the pill for a month and a half now, and my mood swings have become unbearable.  I think about dying, have panic attacks, break out in a cold sweat and get scared RANDOMLY.  My anxiety is HORRIBLE.  So besides the mood swings and crying randomly, my sex drive is gone, and when I finally do have sex its so painful that I need to stop half the time.  Other than that, no other side effects.  I may just be adjusting and it might get better after a couple more months.

I've been taking Ambien since 2003 and it still works perfectly. I take a fairly large dosage since I have a terrible time falling asleep. It does not work for me if I have had a large meal within 4-5 hours of bedtime. I make 100% sure that I take it and go directly to bed. I made the mistake of staying up in the early days and it is akin to being a black out drinker. It does make me tired in the morning, but it is better than not sleeping!

I have been taking Lutera for a week now, and I haven't had many problems at all with it. The only major side effect that I have had so far is some nausea, but it's bearable, and I only have to deal with it for a few hours since I have been taking at 9pm every night. My doctor said nausea with it is normal and it should be gone in a few months. Overall, I am much happier with it than I expected, some of the earlier posts that I read before I started taking it scared me, and I didn't know what to expect since this is my first time taking birth control pills, but so far it has worked out well!

I've just started taking birth control pills for the first time and my doctor put my on ORTHO LO for the less frequent/severe side effects. I'm mid-way through the light blue pills of my first pack. So far, I haven't experienced any symptoms. No weight gain, my skin hasn't changed, and I haven't experienced any moodiness (in fact, I've felt pretty cheery all week, although I can't necessarily contribute this to the pill). My (normally high) sex drive hasn't changed at all as far as I can tell. I've had sex a couple times since beginning the pill and haven't had any problems with self lubrication. I can't say anything yet as to the efficacy of the pill as far as preventing pregnancy goes. However, both my sisters have been on ORTHO LO for a few years and have been very happy with it. I think it's important to mention BEFORE I STARTED THE PILL, I've always had very regular periods, with very regular monthly symptoms. If you plan to post, it'd be helpful if you gave a basis to compare.

I waited it out for four months, but the serious dark depression that comes and goes does not go away and i know it's from these pills...I decided it's not worth it because it's ruining my social life and my outlook on life.  I used to be happier before going on these pills.  I'm going to switch to another pill ASAP.  I think this pill only works for some people depending on your body chemistry because even though it's low dose it still has that higher level of the synthetic progesterone which does not appear to agree with me.

While it's doing its job (I have unprotected sex in a monogamous relationship with the pull out method and am using this pill as back up) in the pregnancy prevention department, it is absolutely disappointing otherwise. Before starting this pill I was in the average body-fat percentage range, was average in physical activity and was otherwise happy. After starting this pill I have gained almost 20 pounds, can feel water retention on my body, my **** have increased a cup size but they were already big for my size so I do not appreciate it. My appetite has severely increased, and my mood swings are ridiculous. During PMS, I am a complete wreck! Also, while it has regulated my once fickle periods, my period is now heavier than usual and lasts longer than it ever had before. Ultimately, I'm disappointed and after 8 months on this pill, I am stopping it after this month and returning to condoms until I find a better birth control pill.

I only took Yaz for 5 days. The 5th night my husband and i got into bed and i starting having a panic attack. This pill is a pill from SATAN! I became very anxious and started having the worst panic attacks. Heart racing, dry mouth, skakes, and VERY bad depression. I had the worst thoughts like suicide and everything annoyed me. I cried for no reason at a drop of a dime. I have absolutely no appetite even though i stopped the pill 2 days ago. I lost 6 lbs in 1 day. I ended up having to go to the clinic to get seditives to calm me down from the anxiety. My poor husband has been there helping me through it but because of the sedetives i ended up losing my job. It might help some people but it nearly made me want to DIE! Good luck to you ladies who get conned into taking it. At this very moment i am trying to slowly eat food and i only want to vomit.

This is month number 3 on Yaz.  I was still suffering from PMDD for the first 2 months and considered going on other medication.  I decided against it due to my great sex life and how antidepressents take that away.  That alone would depress me.  Now, I have having mild PMS and VERY light, short periods.  YAY!  However, all of a sudden I am having sex headaches.  This is a huge bummer.  I have never had that before.  I have to take Advil an hour before sex.  How romantic and spontanious is that!&#63;! I can't say that Yaz is the reason for the headaches but its going to be great to get off any birth control once my man gets the big V! Other then that I this Yaz is great.

I'm on the 2nd day of my inactive pills and I haven't had a period yet. I've read that this is normal though. Yaz has really really done an amazing job at curing my PMDD. I'm like a regular human being again. No more random depression and outburts of anger that scare everyone away from me. No more crippling shyness and anxiety. It is really absolutely amazing. I have been experiencing PMS. I'm very sensitive right now and nearly everything is hurting my feelings or making me cry, but it's not half as extreme as it used to be. PMDD was interfering with my life even when I wasn't about to start my period -- I can live with a little PMS.

The medicine certainly helped me feel happier and more calm and relaxed, however it did make me gain weight, break out and decreased my sexual urges almost completly. These are pretty major side effects, especially considering the reason I was taking this medicine was because I was depressed and had low self esteem and anxiety. I decided not to stay on it, and the getting off of it part is hard too. Put me in a deeper depression then I was in before I had it.

I want to eat like crazy! I am a big eater to begin with but now while I am eating I am planning what I am going to eat right after I am done with the current meal!I always feel like I am starving..I look like I am 6 months pregnant from the bloating and being constipated..even though I am taking fiber packets!

I'm glad I found this board. Does anyone else get these side effects from Yaz&#63; Right now its 6:21am and I haven't slept yet. I've been noticing that once a month, around the same time I just can't fall asleep... and I actually feel bad for my boyfriend, because one wrong move and I either cry or yell at him for no real reason. Actually, if he DOESN'T give me a reason to flip out on him, I pick fights with him anyway. It's getting to the point where that week that's two weeks before my period, it's better NOT to talk to him. I know it's coming, but I can't help it! On top of this I'm depressed, but anxious at the same time (if you can figure that one out) I NEVER was the PMS type before I started taking the pill, but now I'm a monster! If this is supposed to lessen symptoms of PMDD why am I so moody and depressed&#63; Is this normal&#63; Will switching to another pill help&#63; This is supposed to be low dose so won't a stronger pill be worse&#63; On top of all this...

I was given a low dosage (10mg)of the generic to sleep soundly and not aggrevate a rash. I took it for four nights and each day I got more groggy and iritable.  My wife and daughter paid for my grumpiness.  I constantly felt like I was getting sick, but as soon as I stopped taking the pills I felt 100% better.

I was on Depo for 1 year. It was the worst thing I ever did! I was 23 and in great physical condition when I started on it to deal with heavy periods. I gained over 30 lbs! I got so depressed I was nearly suicidal (never had any issues before). I had unprecedented dental decay and bone loss (broke my arm with a very minor impact). Also had the worst acne of my life. HORRIBLE! It took well over a year after the last shot to get my period back and start to feel more normal again. Three years later I'm still trying to lose the weight. I'm very worried about the long term effects of the bone loss. I took calcium supplements faithfully but they didn't help. As I am a rock climber and very active person this has been devastating.

I recently switched to the Lo version and have to agree with the above mentioned side effects. My skin got really dry and started peeling, and I started getting bad headaches in the evening. I am not sure if I gained weight but I do feel more bloated. However I am surprised that my body could deal with the higher dosed version better than with the Lo one. After taking one course of this pills I am considering to stick to my orginal plan and quit the pill all together. Even though I read about similar side effects (mood swings, weight gain, bad skin) when you quit taking the pill.

This drug works at reducing your blood pressure. But, the side effects are awful.Since it is a beta-blocker your pulse/heartbeat will come way down. I felt incredibly tired and sluggish all the time and didn't have the energy to do anything physical. I gained wt. because I was too tired to exercise.

This drug can be used to calm you down, or to use as a sleep aide. I use it as a sleep aid, but along with other drugs too. I've never had any problems with it and wouldn't want to stop using it.

I have been on Lutera for about a month now and so far so good.  I have tried everything from the Merina, NuvaRing, to OrthoEvra.  The OrthoEvra was the best, but I am sensative to the adhesive, Everthing else gave me a series of side effects.  After having my baby, I suppose my body has changed and has been rejecting everything, so my OBGYN suggested Lutera.  Month 2 and I no complaints, no weight gain, I just don't like having to take it every day, but gotta make sacrifices somewhere.  It is different for every female, so good luck, you don't know until you try it.

I find it really interesting that there are so many negative reviews on this bc!!! I love otcl. I have no mood swings, my periods went from complete nightmares to 3-4 days of light bleeding and I retained my same 110lb figure.  The only thing that posed a small issue was having to receive this prescription from my insurance company, instead of receiving it at the local CVS, which is the problem of my insurance company actually.  Honestly, I noticed absolutely no changes whatsoever when I started taking this pill.  I've been on it for 2 years now and have been consistently happy. Perhaps I'm just made for this pill huh&#63;

For myself, any effectiveness of effexor xr, is blunted by the nausea, thirst, sweating, abnormal body odour, soaked feet, ringing in ears, yawning, headache, mouth sores, sleep disturbance, and total equipment failure. What makes it worse, is that one cannot temporarily go off it to relieve the symptoms, because of the horrendous withdrawl effects, which include electrical short circuits in your head. Once you quit this, you do not want to go back.

I have been on Lutera for a month now and just started my period yesterday. I am having a very light flow and the few days before I started I had a little bit of spotting but it wasn't bad at all. I have gotten some acne and had a bit of an upset stomach when I started, but it's really not all that bad. I went on the pill to help with cramps and I have not had any so it's doing what I wanted it to do. You have to take the good with the bad, and I just went and picked up another pack so I'm thinking I'm better on them than without them!

This is one of the best pain killers there are. Many Physicians say they do not like to use it because it causes siezures. I am disabled and have taken all the pain killers you can imagine M.S. Norco, Darvecet Hydromorphone, Which is Dilaudid, Fentnal, Vicodin, lorcet, Percoset, percodan, methadone etc, etc ,ETC and Demerol is the best for me especialy when taken with phenergan or and Oxy- contin if your in pain try these three. But consult you DR first. And Oxy-Contin is so exspensive and I believe the reason why Dr,s don't want to use Demerol is because they want to make the drug comp[anies more money because Demerol is alot cheaper then any of the other pain killers. And I take Demerol for pain everyday and I have never had a siezure. Itr is the best apin killer and it definately wi;ll help you to rest when in pain severe pain thats what I like to do is rest and relax.

My 11yr old grandson is now taking 40mg of strattera. took almost 3 weeks to notice change, but there was one, he could focus, and was happy, a joy to be around. Vomiting and nausea a problem, not sure how to cure that, doctor tried 1/2 dose of 25mg of phenergan for the nausea and it made the strattera not work at all, he was back to his old self, unhappy and unfocused, so i'm not giving him the phenergan anymore, but to zero on this. I want to continue to give the strattera. Does anyone have suggestions on the nausea and vomiting&#63;

This was the most horrible drug I have ever taken.  I was taking it for depression/anxiety and it did NOTHING to help with that even up to 450 mg.  No one warned me about the brain zaps and I thought I was going nuts.  I'd be sitting at the library table and suddenly feel like I couldn't move and there was a buzz in my ears.  Coming off wasn't too bad because I was also starting up on Prozac at the same time.  The overlap helped mask the withdrawl.  Actually I don't remember having any problems coming off at all.

I have been taking Yaz for almost a year and cannot believe I've kept taking it this long.  I have absolutely NO sex drive.  I also have no will to go out and/or socialize.  Besides these two things, I have had hair loss and rashes on my face. It has been great at regulating my period and giving me a lighter flow and less cramps, however, the negative side effects definitely outweigh the benefits.  I am changing next month when I go to my doctor again.  I wouldn't advise taking this pill unless you don't want to have sex...or a life.
-1.0
So glad I read these posts! I thought I was a smart person, but I didn't link my terrible side effects to the Yaz until now. I've been on Yaz for 5 mos. Now I get migraines with nausea, depression, moodiness, sleep problems, non-existent sex drive, (new) leg numbness and I don't know if this is related, but I've experienced what feels like low blood sugar: extreme fatigue in the afternoons. I just can't stay awake. I'm going off Yaz immediately. I went on it for PCOS & fibroids but this is much worse. My Drs are completely unaware of these problems when I have mentioned them and he suggested that I take MORE drugs for depression & sleep. I'm so mad that I've ruined myself for this long before I figured it out!

Ambien has been a life saver for me. I do multiple calls to India 3 days a week and that is after my normal 9 to 5. My body would reset at 9PM for another 8 hour day and I would end up with 2 or 3 hours of sleep to do it all over again. After a few weeks of this I was starting to lose it and had put on 10 lbs just from lack of sleep and stress.  My doc gave me a full physical and perscribed me some Ambien to help with my sleep issues. A month later and I am back on track. By nature I am a 'stay up and do things at night guy' but as a professional I need to be solid and comprehending during my workday. Ambien has given that ability back to me an I take it 2-3 nights a week. It works FAST on me. I tend to take it and settle in for some TV. I never remember what I watched or how I got into bed or who ate the last banana. Its Evil that way but without it I'd probably be going insane or unemployed. I take it for other reasons (night befre hard labor etc) and I probably won't remember this:)

The effectiveness was great because I didn't get pregnent but I'm switching to LoOvral (the only other option at the Health Dept. where I get it for free) because of the side effects. I did not gain weight on this birth control or feel really bloated which was nice. The 2 main side effects which are causing me to switch are total loss of sex drive and feeling overly emotional. The sex drive thing is the worst! I just lost my virginity at 25 and was so excited (literally!) to be able to have sex. I wanted it at least every other day but since starting Ortho lo I have seen my arousal disappear. I'm not sure how much the emotional stuff will be helped by switching since most BCs I've tried seem to affect me somewhat in that arena (ortho lo did not affect me as bad as Yasmin. Yasmin made me psyco!). Finding the right BC sucks when you don't have insurance!

I can not begin to explain how strattera has changed my life and I mean life. I used to lock my keys in my car ALL THE TIME, loose my purse, my phone, my time card and be in a constant fog. Now I can keep up with these things, hold a conversation with out forgitting what the h... we where talking about and stay focused at work. My mood is better because I have more energy, more confidence and stay focused. THANK YOU STRATTERA!

I tried Nuvaring after trying Ortho Evra & Tri-cyclen and hating them. It was fine for a couple months, then I started experiencing a fiery burning sensation. Sex gradually became painful over a couple weeks until the point where it was overwhelming no matter how gentle my husband was. I wasn't sure what the cause was until a friend mentioned she had to quit using hers for the same reason. I took it out, and the pain disappeared. I switched to Yasmin, and have been taking it continuously for several years with no problems whatsoever. I can't believe some of the horrors women go through for birth control, seems counterintuitive to take something that makes you gain weight, kills your sex drive and turns you into a cranky & angry person... I feel lucky to have found Yasmin on the 4th try at BC, seems like most women end up trying a dozen different things before finding the right one or giving up altogether.

I've been on this pill for about 5 or 6 months now. I haven't experienced any side effects since the beginning. It didn't help my skin or make me gain weight (perhaps slightly in the ****), but it is effective in its intended purposem and after the third month it helped regulate my period. It's a bit pricey, but as a college student it is available at a significantly cheaper price.

I switched to Loestrin 24 fe from ortho evra 2 months ago and as soon as I did, I started having the worst mood swings, anxiety, and had a major case of depression. To add to that, my breast size has shrunk, I now have insomnia most nights, I'm have low sex drive and vaginal dryness, and my period is now non-existent; have not have a period yet and I am now going on my 3rd pack of pills! I'm guessing a birth control pill with as high a progestin level as Loestrin does, does nothing good for me. I'm switching to one that's higher in estrogen, lower in progestin.

not bad at all, but its moderately effective.  i had zero side effects, aside from being a little tired.  i was taking 3 mg daily for 2 yrs but it just wasnt helpin my panic attacks that much.  i took my time comin off of it.  it took me a year to get off of it.  i reduced my daily dosage by 0.25mg once a week, but only when i felt comfortable enough to subtract a little.  after a year, i got off of it completely without any incident or withdrawl effect

Well here I am on this site b/c I have a HORRIBLE headache that I've finally related to YAZ and my period. It hurts so bad I want to cry so I wanted to research the correlation between headaches & YAZ. The headaches make me feel nauseaous and the smell of certain foods make me want to gag. When I 1st got on this pill, everything seemed fine...grew almost a full cup size it seems & VERY light periods that last ONE day!!!! However, when that time of month comes around, I feel anxious, feel like I'm going to scream & EVERYTHING annoys me...my patience becomes VERY limited & I hate that I seem snappy with anyone that I care about...liked the bigger chest :) but don't think I can handle these headaches anymore BLAH!!!

I'm usually optimistic most of the time (or if i get down, i am up and happy again like 2 mins later!) but for 2 days straight i've been really depressed! I hope this changes!!

Little did I know that Lexapro is given to sex offenders because it is believed to have the worst sexual side effects of all antidepressants.

Besides that, it gave me terrible depression and suicical thoughts. Beware

I have been taking Strattera for 2 months now and I am beginning to think it is time to STOP! I got a horrible ringing in my ears about 2 weeks ago! And if I miss a dose I get a headache from hell.  I have had some improvement in attention but not enough to put up with the horrible headaches and this non-stop ringing. The worst part is my doctor doesn't think this symptoms are related to Strattera but rather that I am coming down with a flu-bug!!!!!!!!! WHAT&#63;&#63;&#63; Make sure you do your own research! I would not recommend Strattera and am stopping it.

Amazing drug. Thats all i can say. Amazing. After a horrible run with Lexapro, I was switched to Zoloft. All of my depressive symptoms are gone for the most part. Only issue i had was with insomnia. A little Seroquel cleared that right up. Very cheap as well. Amazing all around.

I've only been on Ortho Lo for a month and a half, but so far so good. I have a lot less side effects than my previous BCP's Yasmin and regular Ortho. Instead of depression and moodswings, I'm having headaches and nausea, but my period is still really light and my sex drive isn't completely killed, so I don't mind. No generic, so I have to pay a little extra at the pharmacy, and I still hate taking it every day. Very effective, because I'm not pregnant yet, but we'll see what happens after a few more months! I hope the side effects don't get any worse. I may need to update my review.

I took this drug for a little over 2 months.  I had breakthrough bleeding the first whole month.  Major symptoms were nausea every minute of the day and sometimes in the middle of the night too.  I also lost my sex drive :(  I had no energy, became irritable for no reasons and also constantly depressed/sleepy. I have been off for about three days now and nausea is subsiding and i'm in a good mood.  I remember breaking out in the first month also( I never break out).  Hmm, what else&#63;  I never had trouble wearing my contact lenses.  I also have had upset stomach for the past month or so, but i don't know if that's related.

For panic attacks, take alprazolam (generic Xanax) sublingually for the quickest relief.  Forget about the $$$ name brand.  I did well for years with 0.5 mg at bedtime, and as needed for acute anxiety.  After a very bad medical debacle, my psychiatrist upped the dose to 8 mg per day.  It was a BEAR to taper off that dose!  Miserable withdrawl symptoms!  Below 2 mg total dose per day, I never had a problem.

I could think!  It was a miracle.  ;-)  I have tried many medications and alternatives for ADHD.  Adderall has far and away done better than any of them.  Yes, it decreases appetite, and gives a person insomia.  Given the alternative--distractability, inattention, tactlessness, hyperactivity--insomia and a lack of appetite are not a big deal.  Too bad I have grown tolerant to it.

I originally got this to help me sleep several years ago. It worked alright for that, but for me it took about 40 minutes to take effect.  No side effects though.  However while taking this for insomnia, I discovered that it works GREAT for panic attacks/terrible social anxiety & times when I was feeling suicidal. It was the only thing my psychiatrist & I have been able to find that helps with this, though no one seems to have heard of this.  I wish they'd do a study on these effects because it has literally SAVED MY LIFE.  The only problem is that for me it has always taken the full 10 mg to have any effect and it only lasts about 1 hour, so the bottle lasts only about 3 weeks instead of 4. I'm a normal weight so I don't know why this is. Maybe the CR will help&#63; Also be careful not to take too much because once I took 15 mg and it gave me double vision. Anyhow, if any doctors read this PLEASE DO A STUDY on how this might help some people who are suicidal. It could save many lives.

I've been using nuva ring for 2 months now, and after some initial hesitation, I have only minor problems/complaints. Yes, for the first few days, I did feel super emotional and irritable. But once my body adjusted to the hormones, I was fine! Periods are MUCH lighter, hardly anything! But I do still get cramps, but nothing super bad. Just the it's coming sort of cramps. Only other major issue is that I have been breaking out like crazy lately...By 3-6 months, it's supposed to subside, once your body adjusts to the hormone levels. I'm willing to put up with that minor worry for the convenience and lighter periods! I love not having to take a darn pill EVERY day!!

I have two unrelated very painful nerve conditions and Lyrica has done wonders. Without it I would be curled up in a ball of pain, living only on narctics, but not really getting pain relief. I can function now! I am up to 400mg daily and only have some mild side-effects that come and go: very slight dizziness, and rarely,slight blurred vision. I think as a good side-effect, it has acted as a mood stabilizer as I have recently been in a very stressful situation and I have managed to be calm and not fall into depression as I have before. My insurance covers it and it is a great value since it gave me my life back. Without this relief my only options are surgery or some experimental injections and both have uncertain outcomes.

Methadone works very well for chronic pain.  I took it for several years.  I stopped taking it for about a year, and when my MD put me back on it, I had problems with hallucinations over 10 mgs daily.  I did lose a lot of weight, so that could have had something to do with it (being smaller, so my body couldn't handle it).  10mgs daily is not a high dose at all.  Overall, I highly recommend Methadone for the management of chronic pain.

I ran out of my prescription and was waiting for it to come in the mail and noticed w/out it I started sleeping better and have been even in mood.

I can't say much because I only took it one time, but I only took 0.5mg and it caused irregular menstrual bleeding.

I've been taking Yaz for eight months. I never had any problems with my period other than it was really heavy, and Yaz seems to have lightened it more than halfway.  My only complaint is the same as many others... no sex drive, whatsoever. Instead, I feel like 'Not again'... lol.  I started taking this pill before I started having sex, and I've never once to achieve an orgasm. I think my boyfriend's going to give up trying to get me there.... since it's apparently never going to happen.  If I knew I could take something else that would help with that, I would! I'm just afraid to take another pill that will make other symptoms appear.  I actually got a prescription for TriNessa awhile back but I didn't take any of it because I don't want to deal with that 2-3 month time of everything straightening itself out.  Sigh. What to do, what to do.

I was given this to help with my nervous system, upper gastrointestinal IBS, fibromyalgia, and mild anxiety/depression. It has been the only drug to work for all of them! I went from vomitting 3-4 times per day, anxious, and overwhelmed to the point of insomnia and now have a 'normal' life. I have missed very little work due to health issues and have been able to live a stable life. I've even skipped doses occassionally and it has been fine... after my body adjusted to the drug... the adjustment period was a little weird. My doctor said people often go one of two directions, they either get really energetic or really sleepy during their adjustment period. I got both... so I learned I had to take it right before bed... I got tired... and then the energy would kick in about 10 minutes before my alarm went off in the morning... so sort of a win-win situation there... it's been that way ever since.

This drug works like a charm.  The only thing I didn't like was as I was falling asleep, I would feel like I was being lifted off the bed and then all of a sudden, I would fall (felt this way, didn't actually happen).  I spoke with a couple of other people taking Ambien, and they had the same sensation.  Still an excellent sleep aid.  One thing, my MD told me not to take it everynight...every other night or every three nights.  Your body can become used to the medication and not work as well.

I have never taken more than 50 mg daily of Lyrica for peripheral neuropathy in legs/feet, arms/hands, and at times, my face.  Although it does take some of the pain away, the side effects include a fogginess that makes me almost unable to do anything, and tinnitus (ringing ears).  Still, I take it when I have nothing else to reach for, as oxycodone and tramadol cause me even worse tinnitus.  My ears are very sensitive to meds after they were damaged while serving in the military (noise) and flying (barotrauma).  Two epidural shots and four cervical shots have helped little.

didn't work at 10 mg but then raised up to 20 and worked a little too hard on my body.  gave me lots of headaches and palpitations, but didn't want to complain to doc.  All of it went away and unless I drink cofee, I don't get jittery or anything.  Overall, it works great and I can do extensive studying and get the grades that I want without dozing off and thinking about other meaningless things.  I do notice a bit of a sexual side effect though.  anyways, xr works great! I would deffinately reccomend this drug to anyone who isn't looking to get a high off of it. I can see how it can become addicting, and it would suck if the addicts ruined it for the people who really NEED to use it! So don't abuse it, it will kill you.

i've been on lutera for 6 months now and i've been great. i don't have any cramps (they used to be very bad) and my period is slightly lighter (it wasn't that bad before the pill). it is my first bc and i'm pretty happy with it. the only side effect that i experienced was spotting for few days for first 2 packs .

Being on birth control pills for over 5 years, I decided it was time for a change. The ring is quite convenient because you don't have to think about it for a few weeks, and I was excited to try it. But I have totally lost ALL sex drive. I feel so bad because my boyfriend wants/needs it (especially after a week, poor boy) and I feel like I'm making up excuses now....this isn't me! Sex is also quite painful, my best guess is due to the hormones being released directly onto the vaginal tissue- it makes it super tender. I also have what seems like a tension headache every day. I just got on the phone with my doc to be put back on birth control pills. I tried it and it just didn't work out for me.

I've been taking Lutera for a little while now and have not had any problems what-so-ever.  There are a lot of negative reviews on here and when I was about to first start taking it I got freaked out by everything people said.  I think that mostly people who have a hard time with a drug are more likely to rate it than people who don't have a problem with it.  That's why I'm putting this up here. No weight gain, no stomache pains, no headaches, and no spotting...I just go about daily life as normal. Don't be freaked out because of the reviews, but if you get any of the side effects than you should seriously reconsider a different alternative drug.

The good: I had horrid - close to childbirth pain - in my back due to 3 herinated/lacerated disks in my lower (L4 & L5) Vertibrea - and one in my neck.  Anyway, Lyrica took away the pain - THE BAD: I'm SOOOOO disociated from the world it's like I'm in this nightmare tunnel and I can't quite seem to focus on real life.  The doctor said this was depersonalization and to stop taking it - I've only been on it 2 days at 150 mg.  It WORKS.  Tomorrow the pain will return - but HOPEFULLY my brain will return too.  I'll take the pain over this horrible feeling.  Lyrica should be taken off the market - or doctors should warn patients about this.  I can hardly function.  Please DO NOT take this drug anytime during the day or at least when people - see your children -  are depending on you - until you know how you're going to react.  Thanks.

I started taking this drug when it was brand new. It helped the depression at first, but then stopped working quite as well.  I only remember one significant side-effect: complete loss of appetite.  I was NEVER hungry. After four months, I switched to a different antidepressant, because the weight-loss was getting worrisome.  I didn't experience any withdrawal symptoms, as i have with some other drugs.  I've recently started taking it again, and my appetite is unaffected.  I can't be sure about side-effects this time, as I started taking birth control pills the same week, and i don't know which one is making me feel ill.

Wow I am so glad I read this review! I got some Yaz from my doctor and I havent used it yet because I was worried about taking a BC pill. Years ago I tried Ortho and Estrostep and I felt really sick and horrible and had horrible cramps. So since then I havent taken any BC pills. So after reading this I definitly am not going to take it now. I would rather suffer through the PMDD once a month then put up with all the side effects. I am going home and throwing that stuff away.

I have been on Ambien since the day it came on the market. I have a sleep disorder that requires me to be medicated for sleep to occur. The trick to Ambien working is to take it on an empty stomach.  If you eat before taking it, it will not be as effective. Also, you can probably get away with less if you have an empty stomach. I do not have any side effects the morning after... BUT.. it does somewhat blank out memory after taking it. Make sure you are in a safe place and go right to bed after you take it.

I took this pill for 6 months after switching from Ortho-Tri-Cyclen to try the lower estrogen dose.  I felt bloated, experienced stomach cramping/gastritis, bad breast enderness during 2nd & 3rd week of pills and bad PMS/mood swings, irritability & terrible cramps during period.  I was surprised as I thought lower estrogen dose would be better.  I switched to Cyclessa which was better and resolved most side effects, but I experienced BTB in last week of those pills.

This is great for moderate anxiety- it is the only thing that helps when I have symptoms of Globus Histerious (lump in throat feeling associated with GAD) or stress related chest pain. I have no side effects at all, although I have heard it makes some people sleepy. This stuff works 100 times better than the anti-depressants that they always want to give you (I have had bad luck with those, either due to lack of effectiveness or side effects or both). I think that this is an excellent medication!

Does wonders to help you concentrate. Lasts long, so don't take it too late in the day. Take drug holidays here and there, as the body builds up tolerance to it within a few weeks. It's a stimulant, so you'll have little appetite while on it. I was about 245, 250ish when I started using it, and now I'm around 195. Also, it's not called kiddie coke for no reason.

Well I've been on Orhto Lo for about 4 mons. and I have to say I really didn't have any side effects until this month. The only thing is that this pill doesn't help with my cramps and my period is almost as heavy as it was when I wasn't on BC. And I have almost no sex drive whatsoever!!! It sucks because it is causing problems with my boyfriend! I can't find a pill that works for me!

hated this pill!!! my period was always late. the third month on i developed migranes, headaches, mood swings, shakes, muscle cramps and spasms.. i diagnosed myself with thyroid problems and then realized these symptoms started and worsened when i got on yaz. i thought i was pregnant because all of these problems, and i have a baby so i know how it feels. so glad i found this site because i realize im not alone. just called the doctor and im thinking of switching to loestrin 24 fe&#63; its ratings aren't too bad, just break through bleeding and i can deal with that. id rather bleed than have migranes.

I love this drug. For the first time in my life I can think. When I decide to do something it gets done. Now. Urination is sometimes difficult but the worst effects faded after a month. Sexual response has changed a little but no better or worse. The only problem, and it's become serious, is the ringing in my ears. It's loud enough to cause a problem if I was still a movie sound editor. Good thing I'd already changed careers. The drug is also expensive and my insurance doesn't cover it. I do manage to find it on-line for $2.80 a tablet occasionally. I take 100mg (40 & 60) so it costs a minimum of $5.60 a day. I figure it's worth it 'cause I'm far more productive than that in a a day. I'm also taking Lisinopril 10mg for high blood pressure. If you start this drug, start at a low dose (18 or 25 before moving up) and stick with it for at least a month for the side effects to fade.

Yes expansive $114 to be exact. So if you don't have insurence that covers it...My experience was that it made me be able to relax more, and I do miss that, but I tried to finally pay the $114 since I lost insurrence moving to sc, and I found it kept me awake. Before when I was on it I didn't realize why I couldn't sleep, but now I do. The benefit of concentration was not worth the lack of sleep. My boyfriend says it made me more hyper, but I don't know. The sleeping thing was crazy though because when I went back on it I went stright on 60 mg, and I was kicking, and very agitated.

i have mixed reviews on this one.. it took my pain away which i had never had anything do that before and i actually slept when i always have problems sleeping BUT i starting having vision problems and halucinating on it.. it might just be because i am on other meds but also after two weeks it wasn't as affective but still worked great compared to what i have been through

I have only been on lo for a month and a half but it seems to work great. I haven't had any of the terrible side effects mentioned by many people.  the only thing bad that has happened is i have some breast tenderness and my **** have gotten a bit bigger too. the tenderness seems to be going away though. i think it might be because i didn't have enough estrogen in my body to begin with though. for most people it is adding more but for me it is adding just enough i think. my sister has the same problem- not enough estrogen. plus, i have a HUGE sex drive normally (i mean, my husband is the one who is saying, no hunny, i'm too tired) so making the sex drive normal wouldn't be so bad, but it doesn't seem to have been effected at all.  anyone have any recommendations on a generic drug that is like lo&#63; I don't have insurance to afford the lo! is tri-sprintec good or is it the same&#63;

it's a pretty good pill. been on it for about 3 months. only side effects have been headaches(bad enough that i needed Excedrin)all four days i was off the white pills. also, if you take it late, you will bleed!!! PROS are my period is so light and only lasts about 3 days. some breast tenderness has occured but it's manageable. the only wierd thing is i tend to get very emotional around the 2nd or 3rd week and can be brought to tears by a cute baby on a johnson & johnson commercial(actually happened!) and with my insurance its only about $25 a month. also, i'm not pregnant, so i'm assuming it works very effectively.

This is THE BEST pill I've ever been on.  My period lasts only one day, and I used to have heavy heavy periods.

I have been recommending this to all my girlfriends, and have never been happier with a pill.

The drug works like a dream as far as getting you to sleep and basically taking the edge off of life even while you are awake if you are a regualar user of the drug.  Kinda makes you easy going and not too caught up in the small stuff.  The only bad side, and this is a real concern, is that after you take a pill you loose inhibitions and are liable to do things you wouldn't otherwise.  Add to that, the drug causes memory loss and so you will not necessarily know what you did the night before unless someone tells you.  If you need sleep and are in a safe environment, take the pill.  If you are away from home or with someone you don't know well, avoid the pill.

I have been taking this pill for about 6 months and I guess I would say it is effective because I haven't gotten pregnant.  Side effects I have noticed are some vaginal dryness, breast tenderness (usually not too bad, but this month they really HURT!), and mood swings (mostly in the form of depression and hysterical crying) during week 3. I still get cramps and bloating, but not as bad as I used to and it didn't really shorten the length of my period, but did make it lighter.  My acne has also cleared up fairly well and I am down to just the occasional blemish.  I my appetite has really dimished too, so I have lost a lot of weight, but this might be due to stress and anxiety.  Overall, I am satisfied with this pill and will probably continue taking it.

WARNING: I took Yaz for about 8 months. My Dr recommended the pill to help reduce the moodswings right before my period.  I have tried multiple pills and was in love with Yaz at firt- no weight gain, breast enlarged, acne completely cleared up, light periods, and reduced mood swings . . . then I started to notice the very very negative affects of this pill -- I wasn't having moodswings becuase I had become completely numb of emotion, I had NO sex drive (didn't want to be touched at all), panic attacks, and a constant white smelly discharge.  I am a very physically active and happy person, but this pill changed my personality completely.  I knew something was different but didn't connect it to the pill untill i started reading reviews and realized many woman were going through the same thing.  I mistakenly related the no sex drive and unhappiness to my 6 year relationship and it put great strain on us.  I have been off the pill for 6 months and finaly feel like i'm back to my old self.

I've been on this pill for 4 months now & I HATE it! It has made my periods shorter and lighter, so much so that I haven't even had one this month & am freaking out!

What good is a shorter period when it comes back&#63;  Also, if you're late taking the pill, be prepared to spot.  I'm switching again, 7th time in a little over 2 years...

This drug is EXCELLENT. I helped overcome my anxiety with behavioural therapy but still I get attacks occaisionally. The 0.5 mg dose calms me down very quickly and helps me get on with my life on those days when I am very nervous. Even half a tablet (.25) works for me. I do not take it more than once or twice a month so I cannot comment on it being addictive.

I am disappointed about the side effects I've experienced while using the Ring. EVERYONE I know loves it. I tried it for 4 months and just stopped because I constantly feel like crap. I sleep more than I have in my whole life, I have gained at least 12 pounds (and I had just started losing what I had gained on Depo...) I have been spotting for over a month, and for most of the last 4 months. My boyfriend even calls me cranky pants now... and I am the most optimistic, happy person normally! I, like others on this site, have had the constant tension headache. When I first started the ring I had horrible migraines for almost a week, and never put the two together until I started having other problem side effects. I am really sad because I had a horrible experience with the shot and this was pretty much my last resort.

I've been taking adderall since high school, though it has improved my everyday activities, I stopped taking for periods of time because of the side effects. I got extremely bad head aches,lost a lot of weight, experience bad mood swings, and would cry at the drop of a hat, insomnia I would be up for a few days at a time, and then get sick.

I don't understand how it could fall out without one being aware, it doesn't disappear inside there. I have been on this for almost a year and absolutely love it.

I was diagnosed with ADD and have been on Adderall XR for four months.  It has changed my life for the better. I get things done because I no longer have feelings of being overwhelmed at even simple tasks. In fact, my mind now seems focused on getting things done; my house actually stays clean. Incredibly, I too think very rationally and not impulsively. It was great at killing my appetite in the beginning, but now it seems to be waning. Nonetheless, I can't complain because I am now a wonderful 20 pounds lighter. It has not effected my sleep at all! My heart only races if I drink lots of caffeine so now I try to avoid it. For a person with ADD, it has been a lifesave and I'm glad its available.

Lutera is my first try at birth control pills and  it's not too bad.  I have had a few annoying side effects: mood swings, sleepiness, headaches and spotting in the last 3 days before my period.  But i think i'll stick with it.  I'm starting to get used to it and the sleepiness is starting to get less and less. when i first started taking it i slept for a couple hours every day right after i took the pill.  Now i only have to take a nap every once a week or so.  Overall it's not too bad.

This pill is horrible. I've always been consistent with my weight, however after a few months on this pill, I can't fit into my jeans anymore. I only had to get on this pill because the new pharmacy did not carry my older prescription Lessina.It has made me a bit moody, very nauseated each time I drink or eat certain foods and yes, the horrible horrible weight gain. I'm getting off this pill at the end of this month. Just word of advice, if you don't want to gain 5-10 lbs. then don't take this.

After trying this for 4 months, I finally gave up.  I started getting TWO periods a month, which is *NOT* fun.  They weren't much different from regular periods I would get while not taking BCPs.  The concept for a lower dose hormone is nice, but just didn't work for me.  Might work for others, but I would never suggest it to a friend!

This is truly an amazing drug. Nothing helps me get to sleep better than Ambien. If taken as directed, one can avoid side effects. This drugs acts really quick, on an empty stomach as quick as 15 minutes for me. I take it and go straight to bed. If I don’t then I start to hallucinate, both visually and audibly. Also if I don’t go right to bed I will have major food cravings and start eating. The bad thing is I won’t remember doing anything once the Ambien kicks in. This is just another good reason to go right to bed. There have been reports of people driving or doing stupid and dangerous things while on Ambien. Don’t mess around with this. Go to bed!  I don't wake up with a hangover.  It's half life is 2.6 hours, so sometimes i'll wake back up.  I find it helpful to cut the pill in half, take the first half and then take the second when I wake back up in the early, early morning.  Most of the time I get my 8 hours of sleep.

I have been on Cymbalta 60mg for about 2 years. It has worked well for me when other anti-depressants did not. I was giving up hope.  No none side effects. Caused some drowziness at a higher dose.

had it when in labour with both my kids. found it was great for calming my nerves- majorly!  and in turn relaxing me, and my muscles, to not be so tense, in that way it helped with pain, some, but still felt the tremendous pressure and cramping, I just wasn't freaking out about it

I used it for one month as a sample, but was just so frustrated with B.C. I stopped. It made me loose my entire sex drive, I could not stand to be touched or kissed, I was disgusted by my boyfriend, disgusted with men and sex in general yet still felt horny. It was like I was constantly sexually frustrated no matter how many times I ****d or did have sex. Its definitely convienent & I didnt feel a thing, either did the boy. Good but could be better.

Works very well, I had it when I had severe abdominal pain (intestinal blockage/rupture) and it worked instantly. It doesnt last long however, and you will stop breathing if you take more so for chronic pain I dont feel this is a good choice. For short term its very effective.

I was taking Lexapro for a little over a year for postpartum depression and panic disorder. It helped my depression and I had no bad sexual side effects. I did, however, have an increase in panic attacks. I took myself off of the drug and after about 3 weeks, was able to manage pretty well without it. I now take Effexor for the panic attacks and it works like a dream.

I couldn't understand why I was being so irrational. Im a very happy person but I kept having thoughts of suicide over and over, I hated everything everyone did, other times, I couldn't care less what they did. I imagined the people I loved jumping off cliffs and I laughed cuz I didn't care, I was terrified of being paralyzed and thought about it constantly. There were a few times when I started hyperventilating (before a migraine) cuz I couldn't stop imagining my eyeballs exploding. I wold start crying because it hurt, I was scared, and I felt crazy The sun made me want to cry it was EVERYWHERE. My migraines would last for hours and aspirin/ibuprofen never worked... I would cry for no reason then realize how crazy I was and cry some more. I got red spots all over my face that won't go away, zits on my thighs and chest(even now that I've stopped taking yaz!) and I lost my sex drive, I wanted to punch my boyfriend in the face when he gave me the look Its not worth it, throw it away

I've been on otcl for 4 years. I never gained any weight and could not tell how it helped with acne as i never really breakout to begin with.  I can schedule my life around my period, I get it the same day every month almost to the hour and for only about 4 days.  The only thing bad about this pill is it has decreased my sex drive considerably.  If my bf approaches me that's one thing, but i never have any drive to approach him first.  Just recently within the last 6 months I have been experiencing extreme mood swings a week or so before my period.  At one moment i'm angry the next minute i'm crying and have no clue what about, which just upsets me more.  Not sure if these effects are from the pill as they have just started occuring or if it's something else

Uneven results--works one night but not another. Works quickly one night & takes 2 hrs. the next time.  One night I got up,ate an entire cantalope and drank a bottle of beer with it--didn't know or remember a thing about it & got up the next morning planning on cantalope for breakfast.  Imagine my dismay when my son told me I had already eaten it.

I think it is effective- or it is supposed to be! I haven't had any problems with it yet-- its really easy to use, especially for me because I always forget to take pills! My insurance doesn't cover it yet so I have to pay $60/month, but so far its the best fit for me!

Research this drug before taking it.  It helped slow down my brain when I needed it.  I had a very tramatic experience in my life and it helped me for a few months.  I went off cold turkey and I had horrible withdrawls.  This is a very strong drug and I will never go back on it again.  It didn't allow me to feel anything (good or bad) or think straight.

oh my god where do i start&#63; this drug is horrible. made me so tired, made me throw up every morning, sweat a lot, cold flashes, hot flashes, bad headaches, made me confused...really confused! i barely had enough energy to take care of my newborn! i actually can't think of ANYTHING good about this drug. no kidding, if you're thinking of getting on adhd meds, do not try this, the only reason i can think of for a doctor to put you on this, is they are afraid to hand out stimulants...whoop-de-doo.

I am now into my 2nd month of loestrin. The first was hard for a while (headaches which are gone now) but I have had no breakthrough bleeding, my **** are quite tender but also got larger which I didn't mind :-). skin remained clear so far. I can't evaluate it's pregnancy preventing capabilities because I don't take it for that (just want the shorter periods) but so far so good- a little expensive though I think.

I had been on the Yaz for about a month now. At 1st it was ok but now I'm REALLY GLAD I stopped taking it. Its given me a BAD rash of some sort thats spreading and peeling.

I have been on Lutera for almost a year in order to get rid of my AWFUL periods, no joke! Took a few months to work, irregular bleeding but now no period, just some spotting now and then. But I have become sensitive to light, get migranes and I wear contacts. These side effects scare me and my gyno told me to stop taking it asap. I'm still on it because once I stop my periods will be super heavy and need to find something less dangerous. Anyone else out there with migranes that started after being on Lutera for awhile&#63; I have to wear sunglasses a lot! Any suggestions, anyone tried the pill where you get a period four times a year&#63;

I've only been on the pill for a few days. I started taking it the day of my period on a sunday. It is amazing how light my bleeding is i only have to wear a tampon and its my 3rd day on my period. Usually the bleeding on the 3rd day required a tampon and backup.Also my cramps are 90%less painful!I used to be in tears. So far only side effects are SLIGHT bloating and irritability. But no depression at all(i actually feel happier!)and no vomiting or headachs. so far so good!

I love adderall.  It is the only thing that has ever worked for me.  I am able to socialize properly, get things done, and be more of a part of society.  The only downfall is the weight loss.  I have dropped 20 lbs in 2 weeks.  It justs falls off...only a problem because once u start dropping weight, you want to keep dropping it and it's not healthy.

I only gave a 3 for convenience b/c it didn't give me a lighter, cramp-free period as had the Pill.  (Zovia is great!)  Also, although you can take it out for three hours per day, it's odd to have to excuse yourself to take it out, rinse it off, set it aside, and remind yourself to put it back in later.  If I left it in, it would throw my boyfriend off a little bit to be fingering me and feel it.  During sex it was a bit odd, too.  It didn't change my taste or smell, though,  according to my bf.  (Someone made that comment below)  My main complaint is not having better periods.

My psychiatrist prescribed this to me in my freshman year of college because I had problems concentrating on readings and staying awake in general. It did help me read a bit faster (or at least concentrate better), but after not too long, I started getting mood swings, a dry mouth, and feeling sweaty whenever I didn't take it. And I hadn't even been taking much. I stopped using this on my own, and eventually another doctor I saw was shocked that w/pre-existing anxiety my old doc had given me this.  Eventually I learned that general anxiety kept me from focusing & reading faster & writing papers on time. Taking something for anxiety helps me with these issues much more than Adderall.  So I suggest if you have any anxiety/stress problems, deal with those and stay away from Adderall.

Took for about 4 months and quit cold turkey. I felt that it wasn't doing anything for me and I was right. Nothin has changed since i have been off of it in the last 6 months.

its 6am, i'll probably fall asleep soon, and wake up around 2pm, and this has been my sleep pattern for the past week. i have abnormal food cravings, and i have to go the bathroom all the time. i thought i was pregnant, especially with my bloated abdomen. i took a pregnancy test yesterday, and it came out negative. also, im a hornball, and i can get into the mood on this pill, but i get into the mood and it lasts about 2 minutes. and after 2 minutes into sex, im about ready to push my boyfriend off of me. i flip out at my parents, and my boyfriend constantly. i dont feel the urge to go out anymore, everything seems to annoy me. oh not to mention that for the past week i have been farting like crazy. my acne is out of control, im now even getting zits on ****. now heres what i found weird, i started the pill on the day 1 plan, the first day i got my period, and now i have my period again a week and half later! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PILL TO ANYONE!

I am on my first pack of lutera and should have gotten my period by now but have not yet- I take it regularly and on time every day and use a back-up method too so don't think I'm pregnant, but am worried as to why its late.  I switched to Lutera from Necon (generic for Modicon) because Necon was too strong for me and I already deal with depression so it really made me a roller coaster case.  So far it is good other than my late period; no other side effects as described by other reviewers.  Hopefully it is just because Lutera seems to make some of these women's periods lighter so it is maybe shortening mine&#63;  good luck!

This is probably one of the cheapest antibiotics. I take it for sinus infections and it is strong. Every single time I get a yeast infection. The last time I got a yeast infection in my throat (thrush). It also can make you nauseated and cause stomach upset. But, it does get rid of the infection

I have been on this BC for about 6 months now. I started taking Yasmin and liked it, but switched to Desogen because Yasmin was too expensive ( 50 per month through university). I started taking OTC lo when Desogen was discontinued at my college pharmacy. I am torn about my opinion of this pill. The best thing about this pill ( besides not getting pregnant) is that my fairly bad acne completly cleared up, also my severe cramps were eliminated, and my periods became very regular. I have never experiaced break-through bleeding on this pill or any type of pain. I have gained about 15 pounds, an although some of the gain may be because of stress, I seem to be unable to lose te weight no matter how hard I try. I have never had a hard time losing weight before. I also seem to produce little to no natural lubrication and have a decreased sex drive. I get pissed extremely easily, and am much more emotional than before the pill.

Yes this product is expensive, but for most it does work. Before this drug, my life was crazy and it was driving my family crazy. Anxiety plus depression is a bad thing to have. Family, School, Work, ect... is hard enough until you add on these two problems. This drug does have side effects (but which one does not). When I take the medicine I function much better than I do without. BEfore all I did was cry, get sick, and sleep. Now I rarely cry, get sick, and I sleep much better. If it works for you then take it, I know I will until I can figure out another way to get by with depression and anxiety.

This medicine was great when I was going through a divorce and not having sex-but now I realize my libido is gone-non-orgasmic. I thought it might just be me but after reading some of the other reviews I am relieved to see I am not alone. I also bled for a full month when I started this medicine-that eventually stopped but the no sex drive makes it not worth it for me. I look forward to finding some other birth control that won't completely cut out my sex drive.

I have been on Loestrin 24 FE for 3 months now and I love it. I've had no side effects at all and my period is only 1 day and very light. I have no acne problems like I did on other pills and no increased appetite. After being on several other pills before and Depo-Provera, I will not go back to anything else.  I like the convenience of the packet it comes in b/c it fits even in my wallet and looks discreet.  The value is great given the fact that the price is not much different than other pills I've been on.  I definitely recommend this pill to anyone dealing with PMDD. If you don't get the same results, you can always try something else.

I have been on this pill for 2 years now. At first I didn't experience any side effects at all but recently I have. In the beginning I did notice my ***** did get bigger, I went from a 32C to a 32D. Now recently I have been feeling constant anxiety attacks, along with mood swings and stress (which is probably because of all the changes in mood). I would not recommend this pill to anyone. I am going to the doctor on friday to see if she can recommend another pill with less side effects. I hope she can!

This is an effective drug for men that have had  some tostesterone loss.  It is not effective for a major drop in tostesterone.  If your tostesterone is 220 and lower ask your doctor for Striant.

I first tried zoloft, yet it did little to me, so my psychologist talked to me about Effexor Xr.  I dont regret at all taking it.  It has made me feel alot better about myself, and other things around me.   You do get the side affect of a bad sex drive and inability to get aroused, but i was depressed to the point where i couldnt anyway, And after you get used to the drug, your sexual ability will come back with delayed ejaculation... my girlfriend dont complain about that either !  Back onto the point though, I highly recommend this to anyone suffering depression.

After the first week I had HORRIBLE anxiety, to the point of panic attacks. I've been on loestrin before and had absoltely no side effects except for a little breakthrough bleeding, but with lutera within the first couple days I had a RACING heart beat, chest pressure making it hard to breathe, irritable mood swings all day.

I have been on Lutera for 6 weeks now. At first I was nauseous but that has decreased a lot in the last week or two. However, the main problem is the ANXIETY and sluggishness. I am not motivated to do things I would normally enjoy and am having paranoid thoughts. I worry about my body and think I'm getting sick constantly and I think this is because my body feels soooo different on this pill. I took this pill about 10 months ago and had the same symptoms but didn't recognize them as symptoms of the pill until now. When I went off this pill I felt better almost instantly. Within a month I felt like myself again and my body felt normal. I'm going to stay on it for another month because my boyfriend is coming home from Iraq for leave but when he comes home for good, I am finding something else! Why isn't there a pill that men can take yet&#63; :)

Although it seems many users don't have a good experience with Yaz, I'm loving it so far.  It has been a little over a month since I started, and I really like the very light period that has resulted thus far.  No cramping, irritability or anything.  I did have some trouble orgasming recently, but it seems a fair trade-off since I was able to orgasm with about five extra minutes of effort.  My period before starting Yaz was horrific, very very heavy and lasting over a week.  This time around I could barely tell, just a little staining on the toilet paper when I wipe -- no tampons needed, YAY!  I'll withhold further judgement until another couple of months have passed to see if the orgasm issue worsens or any other emotional symptoms crop up.  As of now, I'm as happy as a fly on crap.

It worked really fast, you should be in the bed when you take it. The 1st time I took it, I was about to get in the shower, needless to say by the time I got out of the shower I didnt get a chnce to put my night clothes on, brush my teeth or anything, I headed right for the bed. My doctor took me off of it & gave me something else because he said it is too addictive & its only for short term insomnia. It is also expensive.

I have been taking Balziva for about 9 months.  The first month or so was fine.  I then started getting really bad headaches, even migraines.

Dear GOD... if your Dr. suggests this, RUN! Run as fast and as far as you can. If by some chance you're already on it and it works, great. However if for any reason you don't need it anymore or otherwise decide to stop taking it... IT IS HELL! The side effects are HORRIBLE. I quit taking it and I still have memory, mood, and the weird shocks (if you've missed your dose for a day or so or have stopped taking it, or lowered the dose, you probably understand what this is) from this drug. From what I've read in other forums there are some people that continue to have these effects for many years after discontinuing. This med has far too many side effects and should ONLY be used in extreme cases as a last resort, and doctors should be sued for not making the long term side effects perfectly clear! This med has made my life hell.

Until this past Saturday when I experienced an absolutely horrible headache for over 24 hours, and reading this blog I didn't realize that it was related to Yaz, thought it was work-related stress. I'm going to the doctor as quickly as I can to change my brand of birth control.

I've been on DP for a year now i was 16 so it was great because i hated the pill well i use to be a size 1 now im a size 6/7 my doctor told me the most weight i would gain is 5lbs dat was a lie and then i started to get alot of craving after i got on it and that made me gain alot more weight but the only thing that im growing is my stomach so every1 around me ask me if im pregnant and my boyfriend hates how much weight ive gained. I love it but hate it all at the same time. it made my self esteem really lower. RM VALRICO FL

I started taking Lutera in November of 2006 it was goodi guess you can say.  I did began to feel dizziness at time, nausea and headahces and I did not have a period yet I would spot in between.  Therefore I stoped taking it.  It has been like 3 weeks without taking it.  Two days 4 days ago I began cramping and I knew I was about to get my period.  My period came two days ago.  It has not been a good period but the worst with horrible pain (lower back and abdominal) and I feel very cold.

I decided to stop taking Ovcon.  This is my third month on them.  On the first month, I had just spotting and then on the others, I have had no period at all.  That was great for me! = )  However, I have had some extreme mood swings and I can not handle them anymore.  I have not felt like myself.

PHASEI:  For the first week or so I had severe dry mouth and absolutely 0 appetite because it made me sick and nauseus simply smelling food.  My heart pounded out of my chest and I had perpetually ice cold hands and feet. PHASE II:  Side-effects severely subsided.  Started with 10mg 3x and now take 20mg 3x a day.  I feel alert, I can concentrate to such an extend that I can literally and contently shut out the world.  I have replaced my, gotta take a break attitude with a gotta finish  one. It's been 3 months now and I've lost approximately 30 pounds (nice for me but maybe bad for you).  Still get cold appendages, dry mouth and occasional insomnia but these are easily treated by wearing socks, chewing gum and not taking the drug after 5pm.                                          PHASE III:  Seemed to have built up some sort of immunity.  Drug wears off after 2-2 1/2 hours now and I get EXTREMELY tired in between dosages.  Have to take 4 to make it thru the day.  Still 30p lighter!

Do not take this drug.  I started it 3 months ago and am returning to my doctor this week to get something else.  Since I started this drug I have had low sex drive, loss of lubrication, burning sensations after sex, bleeding during and after sex, severe moodiness during my period, heavy bleeding and bloating during my period, and long painful periods.  I complained to my doctor about these issues and she said to take advil.  The advil did not work, and I am scared to take this drug with all of the clotting issues I have read.

I've been on this close to two months now and I've hardly had a single day without any bleeding since.  My periods are long and the heaviest they have been in my life.  I also get random cramps in the middle of the month, where before I hardly even got them around my period.  I don't know if I should give it a couple more months and see if my body gets used to it and the side effects go away, or I should switch to something new.  Really unhappy with Lutera right now.

Tiniest amount makes me sleepy, so I can only use at night...to stop those racing thoughts & turn off my brain. Only use it once or twice a week. Just knowing I have the bottle in the cabinet makes me less anxious!

I use to get severe headahes and I was taking Mepergan Forte(demerol and phenergan)capsules for pain.they worked well in the begining but after a while I would get rebound headaches and would have to go to the E.R. to get an IV with dilauid and zophran. I guess if you take them only once in a while they work really good but not as an every day headache medicine.

Depo is poison! Go on yahoo and search 'depo side effects.' The first site that comes up is depo horror stories. This drug caused me extreme pain for 5 years, but I never put 2 and 2 together.  And, many women reported not being able have children after getting off it. Your doctor won't tell you any of this, you need to do the research yourself.

Do not use unless you are desparate.  I needed it to get off Benzos.  Gave me suicidal thoughts the first couple of weeks.  It was effective in relieving my benzo-induced anxiety, but it made me wired and gave me gas.  Stopped taking it one month after I quit the benzos.

I'm on my 2nd pack of OTCL in the first week.  I thought it was good at first, but now I don't like it anymore.  Sex drive is ok as it was high to begin with.  My skin is flaky and dry on my face, I'm moody, cry for no reason, which isn't me at all, like another poster said - numb, depressed, more headaches, and I feel bloated and I think I'm gaining weight...my clothes are starting to get tight, and my eating habits haven't changed all that much!!  I don't recommend this pill.  I'm not sure what to take anymore, as I have been on 4 different pills since January.  My doctor is getting annoyed with me because i keep coming in and switching, but I don't want to feel like crap.  Alesse I had breakthrough, Yasmin I had terrible headaches and depression.

I only took trazadone for a week or two.it did not work good for me.I was taking 100mg per night.It made my heart beat very fast and it made me tired but with my heart pounding so rapid it could not put me to sleep.The doctor told me to try 150mg per night but that made my heart race even faster.The only sleep medicine I can actually say really worked very good was ambien.

I tried this after I tried Mircette (which I didn't really like).  It was okay, but I still had the same behavioral/personality related side effects of seeming fake and not myself.  I'm a moody person in general and it kept me on so much of an even keel that dh gave me a nickname and said he'd rather have me moody and brooding.

I am trying this pill as a generic for Alesse.  I stopped taking Ortho Tri-Lo because I had bloating issues, emotional, and mood swings.  I am on my 10th day on this pill, and I HAVE MORE ISSUES NOW!  I have never had acne or skin problems.  With Lutera, I get the chills all the time, BAD ACNE all over my face, and irritation down there. Worst of all, I get a BAD smell down there, and I drink water ALL DAY, take two showers a day (once after I work out, and when I get home from work) plus I eat healthy, healthy food.  SO I am going to quit this pill, and after reading some other reviews, I am going to try YAZ.

Took this for 2 years.  Never had break through bleeding, acne only during the last week.  I am an active smaller person and I gained 10 lbs, on me going from 115 to 125 is HUGE.  **** got bigger though.  Never had cramps before I got this pill.  Stomache hurt if I forgot to take the pill, stomache hurt sometimes if I did.  I became pretty moody sometimes...  Sex drive not so good, but thats because I was constantly worried about my body and weight.  I was pretty iregular with the times that I took it at (wouldnt suggest that) but Im not pregnant so I cant complain.  Just switched to Lutera we will see how that goes...

I hate this pill with a firey passion.  Not only did I gain 15-20 pounds from it (no matter how much I worked out and ate correctly-there was never a change, it made me so miserable and depressed all the time. Yeah, it made me regular and my periods would be on time-It made me a completely different person. I have been off the pill for four days and lost 3 pounds.  Wow what a coincidence!

Although I took this drug years ago I know that I will NEVER take it again. I was on it for about 6 months and did not realize how rotten it gradually made me feel until I was finally off of it. I became a Zombie! I felt emotionless. The bad taste and dry-mouth side effects made it hard to breath at night and difficult to speak during the day. My balance and coordination was all screwed up and I could barely open my eyes in the morning. They would be puffy, red and painfully dry. It also gave me the munchies so bad that I was eating in my half-sleep! I'm not a drug user or abuser but I might have well have been smoking pot. Not good!

I used to be on Seasonal and I hated it because when I got my period, it was really heavy.  I haven't had a period since being on Loestrin 24 Fe (about a year now) and even though I was worried about it at first, my doctor told me that this is what happens with some people.  I love not having periods because I would stop exercising on those days and would feel very crampy.  I have now lost over 30 pounds because I feel great.  Until a doctor tells me that I must have a period, then I will forever be free of them.  Love this pill.

I just got out of the HOSPITAL friday because of Nuvaring! I was diagnosed with a blood clot in my upper thigh... which I just found out has a 20% chance of DEATH!!!! 1 out of every 5 people DIE from this type of blood clot and it's all because of NUVARING!  I am now taking Lovenox INJECTIONS EVERY 12 HOURS to prevent the blood clot from reaching my lungs and causing a STROKE! And will be taking Coumadin everyday for the next 6 MONTHS! I used to tell everyone I knew how great Nuvaring was.... but now all I can say is BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!  Not to mention the lack of sex drive, headaches and painful sex it causes!!!!!!!   PLEASE...... DO NOT USE NUVARING!!!! The hospital bills and twice daily injections (that cost $112 each!) are NOT WORTH the convenience!!! *(I'm a 27 year old, healthy female w/ no prior medical problems!) ***DO NOT USE NUVARING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!***

I started the Depo shot after being taken to the ER for ovarian cysts. It was wonderful at first, but I gained 30 pounds in two months, I had no sex drive, I was irritable and had terrible mood swings. The injection site would be sore for days after getting the shot. It was nice to go in to the doctor once every 3 months instead of taking a pill or changing a patch and not having a period was pretty nice as well. In the end, the side effects were not worth the depression and subsequent 60 pound weight gain. Three months after I went off the shot, I started losing weight rapidly and my mood completely changed.

I've been on the nuva ring for 4 months now. always feel it during sex so I remove it, and I twice now Ive forgotten to put it back in. ummm....we will see how that goes. It does often fall out during sex. It gets pulled out and you dont even realize it. Its terrible that you have to constantly check to see if it's still there! sex drive took a hard toll with this. i was very sexual before the ring and now it's a completely different story. Im going to switch BC because I keep forgetting to put it back in. Otherwise..I did not gain weight on it. I do remove it to have sex, it does get in the way. I have had no headaches or anything. Recently Ive felt sick but maybe thats due to forgetting to put it back in twice after sex.....probably!

Ambien is the truck that the sandman drives....and runs over you with! If you want some deep, bone-resting sleep, this drug will provide it. I took it for the first time when my grandfather was killed. I was staying with family out of state for the funeral and had insomnia very badly. I was waiting for it to kick in so I decided to arrange some flowers for the funeral the next morning. A few minutes into my task, I noticed that my eyes were each pointing in a differant direction. I made it to bed just in time. I could easily have slept soundly right there beside those flowers on the kitchen table all night. I took it for about 2 weeks total and was never disappointed. I did have alot of trouble sleeping for about 3 days after coming off of it , though. It's very addictive!

I had been taking Zoloft since 8th grade until I attempted suicide my junior year of high school (2003).  I was then switched to Effexor XR and immediately my ability to concentrate and care about anything plummeted (along with my grades).  I had always been an A and B student until I received my first C my junior year of high school, then a couple C's and an F my senior year, and then completely failed out of college my first year.  Half the time I would drive to the school only to sit in the parking lot, unable to go to class.  I barely remember my senior year of high school as well as half of last year.  I stopped taking it when I found out I was pregnant in September of 06, and I still have memory lapses.  On Easter, I gave my dad a hug, then my brother, then my step-mom, and then I hugged my brother again because I forgot I just hugged him.  I don't remember plots of movies I watched just the other day.  I feel this is related to Effexor, and the withdrawl effects were HORRIBLE.

I have read reviews right before starting Lutera. This is my first bcp and first contraceptive (never had sex, no injection, no IUD). Im 16. I have menorrhagia, accompanied by bad cramps and sensitivity to light, change napkins/tampons about every 1-2 hours, all of this lasting 7 days, not on and off. On day 6 without Lutera it's light for a few hours then heavy again. This is my 9th day on Lutera, I had started it on the first day of my period, as prescribed by my doctor to help heavy bleeding. The first and second days were surprisingly light, as Ive read it takes a week for it to kick in. The 3rd to 7th day has been like my normal period, really heavy, but not much cramping. The 8th and 9th days are the worst! Bad stomach  and rectum pains (I hold it all in so u wouldnt notice) and my flow changes about every half hour, it would be really really heavy, fill a whole pad/tampon, then after I change it stops, then out of no where a big change once again. Is this normal&#63; I am only 16 an

Surprised to see all the negative comments! Strattera has been perfect for me. Ritalin was good but stopped working after a year or two. I have been on Strattera 3 years and feel wonderful. It was hard getting up to the full dose (80 mg) over a month's time, but then it was great. Only significant side effect was that I dreamed a lot more for the first year, maybe, but that didn't bother me and didn't actually disturb my sleep. It's terribly expensive, but my insurance pays. I am extremely happy with it. I am not diagnosed with ADHD; I take it because I have (had) bad trouble with concentration and attention related to constant dizziness. Strattera has been a godsend for me.

I have been on Ambien for years underthe monitoring of my doctor. My problems were getting to sleep and staying asleep.The downfall is the amnesia it causes. If someone calls you, you may forget the whole conversation the next day. I was gaining wt. because I was making sandwiches at 2am. The amnesia is one of the real downfalls. For the treatment of Insomnia--this is the only med. that has really worked for me.

Watch out for drug interactions.  The drug was prescribed for a yeast infection on my arm.  My doctor did not check my medical records for other drugs.  I was taking clonazepam (klonopin). There is a serious drug interaction with lamisil and all the azole antifungals and klonopin.  I suffered a lot from this interaction.  My suggestion; always ask your physician to check for interactions with other drugs you are taking and then take it a step further by checking websites on your own, finding good sites that are very complete and specific.  Be your own advocate always!

I'm taking this for depression and anxiety, once a day every morning.  Started out on 10 mg my first week, then was bumped up to 20 mg for a month, and then finally 30 mg (the doc has me split a 20 mg tablet in half, and take that with another 20 mg tablet).  The doctor warned me about the sexual side effects, particularly difficulty ejaculating.  Interestingly, I experienced the opposite at first.  I found myself getting erect very easily, and ejaculating quite a bit more than usual.  I experienced this for the first week.  As soon as I was bumped up to 20 mg, I experienced extreme paranoia and sadness for a few days - this passed pretty quickly though.  At this point, I also started experiencing difficulty getting an erection and ejaculating, but my sex drive did not go down.  Then I started to slowly feel better about myself.  You have to be patient with this drug, it takes about a month for the full effects to occur, and I do feel better overall with the anxiety and depression.

I can understand that Ambien doesn't work for some people, but it's a Godsend for me. Maybe I have psychological problems, but unless I take Ambien, I have terrible nightmares. Ambien enables me to sleep soundly WITHOUT bad dreams and I wake up rejuvenated and energized. I've always had this dream problem, so I can't associate Ambien's utility with any kind of dependency on the drug. The little white pills have made for a big improvement in my life. I try not to take them every night, but if I absolutely have to get a good night's sleep, I don't hesitate to take one. The amazing thing is that they work for EXACTLY   7 1/2 hours of quality sleep. Surely as anything, I wake up exactly 7 1/2 hours after I take the pill. A great secondary effect is that I'm losing weight (and I really need to). I understand that one cause for an inability to lose weight is chronic insomnia.

Depo is the best thing to happen to me. On the pill I get extremely depressed and bled every 2 weeks for about 10 days and gained 10llbs.  (I tried 5 kinds of pills).  With depo I did sopt for the first three months but almost 2 years later I don't ever get a period if I get the shots about 11 weeks apart.  My moods are normal and I didn't gain any weight, I lost some! Also, Its not as scary as people make it out to be I'm very erticular about what I ut in my body- I've done plenty of research.  My doctor assured me that everyone in his experience who wanted to get pregnant and went off depo conceived in 6 months or less. Just don't stay on longer than 5 years and if you eat well and are fit and healthy, You should not see any bone loss.

After being on many anti-depressants this was the last one I tried. For me, the only side effect that I felt was hyper and kind of revved up---which made sleeping at night difficult. I was on it for 3 years and it worked. It seemed to regulate the seratonin in my brain and I was able to go off of all anti-depressants.

This seems to really be a love it or hate it pill.  Unfortunately, I am hating it.  My doc prescribed it to me b/c I wanted a bcp that was good for helping mild acne.  So far, there has been no change in my skin.  However, I've had my period since 2 days after I started taking Yaz (3 weeks ago).  It's not spotting - it's actually heavier than my normal period, with more severe cramps & lower backache, and clotting.  It's severe enough that I've decided to stop taking it before my first month is even up - reading these & other reviews makes me realize that it probably won't get much better.  I've taken several other hormonal birth controls, and have never had this bad of a reaction - the worst I've had with other pills & with Depo was moodiness & loss of libido.

Where to begin&#63; I took a total of 2 doses at the specified times. Shortly after my second dose(aprx.1 1/2 hrs.) I began to feel like I was hallucinating. A little while later, I could barely walk..which was very dangerous because I was at a highschool football game with my 6 yr.old and my 2 yr.old. Within another hour, I began to break out into hives all over the tops of my thighs. I had to go to the hospital and get a Benadryl shot. I thought that that was the end of the matter. About a week later, I had another hallucination episode while driving. Back to the hospital I went. the doctor then informed me that what I was experiancing was very common for Ultram and that many people have had the same complaints that I was having. He then told me that these symptoms were just common side efffects of the drug and that it would take up to 2 weeks for my body to metabolize all of the drug out of my system. Use caution if you're taking this drug.

BEWARE! I was on this drug for three months and almost died.  Woke up in the middle of the night with a headache.  Turns out it was three blot clots in the brain! I'm in good health with no previous health issues.  Do your research, several postings on the web of exactly the same symptoms as me.

Pretty solid choice. It works great, but I notice that I become very militaristic when I'm on Adderall. I become very focused on the objective, and the discipline involved. I become very detail oriented throughout the day and I am obsessed with efficiency when I'm on it. Also the loss of appetite and insomnia come with the Adderall but to certain college students this might not really be a downside at all. All in all, the best meds I've had so far, Strattera is absolute garbage.

I just finished my first month of this pill.  I have been on Ortho Cyclen and Yasmin.  I had horrible mood swings, reoccuring yeast infections and no sex drive with O.C. ... Yasmin was wonderful, but I still kept getting yeast infections... so I switched to Ortho Cyclen Lo and I've been ok so far. No infections (knock on wood), no mood swings, no weight gain, and my sex drive seems normal. I have actually initiated sex some! lol It's hard to have an opinon on something when it works differently for everyone, but it is working for me so far. :) If not.. you will hear an update! I actually came on here to see if it has an increased rate of not working and women have become pregnant... which is a rumor i've heard. If anyone else finds any info. regarding that please fill me in! :)

I have been taking Zoloft for several years now and it works very well for me.  The side effects only last about a week or two at the beginning, so that wasn't much of a problem.  Although I think that with any antidepressant, it is crucial to see a counselor in conjunction with your treatment.

Cymbalta has done wonders for me. I've been through a number of anti-depression drugs with varying results. I adjusted to it quickly, no side effects that I noticed. I've come out of my mental closet and am now upbeat and social. I doubt that C is meant for anxiety (my shrink has me on a specific drug for that). I assume that the value rating refers to $$'s; if so, my only complaint is that paying for it is painful.

Nuva Ring has been the worst experience of my life. I've been dealing with a lot of crappy things in my life since being on it and not realizing that it was side effects until looking some stuff up the other day. I have taken it out and will not go back to it. These are the side effects I have had since going on it. 1.Extreme depression 2.No sex drive 3.Sever leg aches the day before I start my period and the day of. 4.Social Anxiety (I've always loved people and can't handle being around anyone. I feel like I'm going crazy) 5.Bad pressure in my head for a couple of days before I start 6.Hard time getting my words out correctly before period starts 7.WEIGHT GAIN! 8.Exhaustion 9.Mood Swings 10.My allergies have been worse than ever since using it. 11.I seem to get sick easier. The only thing good I experienced was the fact that it made my periods lighter, cause I tend to have heavy long periods. I think I can suffer having 8 day heavy periods over all of this crap. DO NOT USE THE RING!!

This birth control gives me headaches everyday. I have had a loss in energy, sex drive, and hair. I suffer from depression and anxiety. I have not been able to concentrate on anything since i started this pill six months ago. My breast are often sore, sex is painful, and i'm very moody. This is not a good birth control. I advise you to explore your options.

I guess it is effective, but I always use a condom as well as the pill. I have been taking this for several months now and I am going to switch next month. I have gained 30 pounds and I eat healthy and am very active. I cannot lose it either - just keep gaining. Went from a size 4/6 to a 10/12. I have gotten a few yeast infections since on this, which I have never had before. My perfect clear completion has now become more like connect the dots. I always need a lubricant and never needed one before. Sex drive is lower than before. MOODY!! I was always happy go lucky and now I am either Dr. Jeckle or Mr. Hyde - depends from one week to the next. Everything pisses me off and I usually am really easy going and well tempered.  I have to pee more than normal. I am bloated most of the time and look pregnant. More tired than normal. Periods are very short and barely have cramps. That is the only plus. i only pay $20 bucks because of my insurance. The pill dispenser stinks - it is hard to get

Effective...yes...I'm not pregnant. Though the side effects have been horrible. It took me awhile to realize that it the pill that was causing my problems. But now I know for sure that's what it is. I've started having massive crippling migraines. Tenderness in my ****. And It's made my anxiety worse and it's made me emotional...not just crying, but anger as well. I do not recommend this drug to anyone.

One day I went to the doctor because I felt like I had mono, and the next minute, I was lying in the hospital, critical with leukemia! I was freaking out and they had to give me an amulance ride from one hospital to the next, so they gave me a Xanax to calm me down. I was soooo greatful. I felt so at peace with everything and ready to start treatments. Now I'm healthy and at home, thank God, but I will always be greatful for that little dose of Xanax a few months ago.

i'm 30 yrs old, black, and i've been on lutera for 2 and a half months. the first month was great, no side effects, weight loss, no period. but at the beginning of the 2nd month, everything went downhill...crazy mood swings, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, bleeding (i've been bleeding for a month and a half straight). i'm trying to hold out and finish this pack before i switch, but my better judgement is telling me to stop taking it right now. this is my first time taking birth control pills, and now i'm scared to try anything else.

I was a PSYCHO on this drug.  I took it due to my low iron within my system and it made me extremely moody, nasty and irritable.  I didn't have any interest in anything.  I hated work.  I didn't want to study.  I didn't want to workout.  I honestly, believe that this drug made me a little OCD, I would be upset if something was out of place or if the dishes weren't always clean.  I was always cleaning and being b*tchy.  My life was hell because of this pill.  I had changed pill packs 4 times in 5 years.  I have been on YAZ for the past three months and I am so happy!  This is the best pill for those who have a moody period than most.

I'm extremely happy with the effectiveness of the birth control, and the convenience is phenomenal. I can't swallow pills, don't want a shot or an IUD, and the patch just seems unreliable to me (I'm afraid it would peel off.. I'm too forgetful to constantly be checking for it), so the fact that I can put it in and forget about it for three weeks is great.  Side effects.. I tend to get nauseous for the second and third day after putting it in, and get some pretty wicked cramps for the first couple days after I take it out, but aside from that, nothing major. I think right now my body's adjusting to it (I've been using it for seven months), so some months are better than others, but overall I'm very happy and despite the nausea (that drives me nuts) and some really heavy bleeding two months ago, I have no reason to stop using it. As far as value goes, I have insurance that covers it completely, but even if it didn't, I'd probably still be willing to pay the $50 a month for the protection

I just started this pill 5 days ago, I have need a low estrogen pill so planned parent hood gave this to me. So far I have had 2 fights with my boyfriend for no reason, I just want to sleep all the time. My head feels like it could explode, my face is breaking out, and i feel nauseous like I am pregnant. I really was getting worried until I read that other girls are having the same side affects. I really need to get this switched to something else!! Hope everyone else has better luck ( at this rate I would rather not have sex than take these pills)

I have been on Lutera for about 6 months with only one side effect - I didn't get my cycle for about 5 months - but I don't think it was from this particular drug - but contraceptives in general because it happened when I was on Ortho Tri Lo also. Good product - good value (I only pay $5 with my insurance).

NOT for Me...was on bc in highschool to regulate my period.  now i am 28 and needed the same problem solved..doctor gave me Rx for Lutera...have been on it for 2 weeks and have decided to stop as of today....i feel terrible, bloated and irritable/edgy.  My sleep is effected, I have constant cramps and am sluggish/depressed.  Clearly, this hormone balance is not right for me.

I have had absolutly no sex drive since 2 weeks after starting nuva ring. And have pelvic pain with it almost all month long which interferes with my sex life.

But there is no need for BC if your not interested in having sex or it is to painful.

Awful.  I started Lutera after not being on BC for many years.  Told my Dr that I needed an extremely low dose of Estrogen because I can get moody as it is.

I had uncontrollable mood swings and some weight gain....

Effexor XR seems to be helping me quite nicley once I got past the side effects. Nausea and sleepy mostly, but also weird dreams. Those who have anxiety may enjoy the mind-numbing side effects. However, if you are blessed with depression and anxiety, this may not work until you have a higher dose. Just yesterday I was told to increase to 225mg. I have been on the drug for about one year+, and haven't reached my target dose yet. Hopefully, this will work!  Since I don't have high blood pressure, I am safe to take Effexor.  It is keeping me sane, but my doc says Go for the gold until I feel great instead of boardline. It is very high-priced. I do have coverage, and it is STILL very costly.  Finally, the withdrawal of this drug is horrible  Please don't ever stop cold turkey. I felt so sick. I couldn't eat/sleep and lost weight even at 120lbs. There were zaps in my head and shaky body feelings. I cried and my roommate found me and made me take it. 3hrs later..I feel fine.  Just taper!

I've only been taking Ortho try-cyclen lo for three weeks now. I only switched to it from Mercette because I ran out and a friend gave me a couple months worth of her pills because she's no longer on bc. Well, since I've started taking them I've had no appetite and for the past four days I've had diahrrea and felt bloated. I feel fine otherwise so I don't think it is the flu and I think it is the pill. Has anyone else experienced this&#63; I don't think I'll continue taking this bc.

My son was on this for 2 days...HORRIBLE! He slept alot the 1st day & had bad stomach pains when he was awake. Got suspended from school the second day on it cause he was VERY MOODY, TIRED & extremely angry. He is not an angry kid so I know it was the Strettera.Even his friends noticed a difference in his attitude in school. He also had terrible leg cramps.He said it felt like his legs were crushed. This drug is dangerous & I stopped giving it to him & switched him to adderral xr.So far so good:)I am upset because his Doctor raved about this drug & said there were minimal side effects. Check all reviews online for Strettera they are horrible! I would have NEVER gave this to him if I knew all the bad side effects. Please take my advice...it's not worth it!

Headaches. Made me sleep my life away. Worked okay for like 3 weeks then stopped working. Was upped to 20mg. That made me feel like my bed was the only place to be, & didn't even help the depression. started cutting myself again while on it (after a 5 year recovery). Violently suicidal thoughts. I guess it can work for some people, but I had a sketchy, constantly changing diagnosis, so how can they determine a proper treatment&#63; Plus I never ever felt emotionally comfortable taking an anti-depressant. Quit it after 2 months and now, 5 weeks later, I still get these little electric jolt feelings followed by slight sluggish-light headedness. I'm now taking 5-HTP, a derivative of L-Tryptophan. I recommend that instead. It's a dietary supplement that helps you make your own serotonin. RESEARCH 5-HTP/L-TRYPTOPHAN (but don't take them with an SSRI). There are other options!

Was on Strattera for 9 months -- began at 25mg and worked up to 80mg.  Noticed slightly improved concentration, but not worth the side effects.  It has the opposite effect of the stimulant AD/HD medications.  I was exhausted all the time -- 10 hours of sleep a night wasn't enough.  Nausea was pretty bad, especially on the handful of occasions when I forgot to or couldn't take it with food.  Dry mouth was severe and annoying.  Of course, everyone will have a different response to this medication, but if the side effects are bothersome, I would advise you (with your doctor's guidance) to look into the stimulant medications, which are known to produce fewer side effects.  I switched to Adderall XR (20mg) a month ago, which has been wonderfully effective in comparison, producing far greater benefits with fewer side effects.  It clearly begins to work as soon as I take it -- no waiting weeks for results as with Strattera.  I haven't looked back.

I've been on the generic Tri-Sprintec for over six months.  It's the first oral birth control I've tried.  It's been effective thus far, and I've noticed significantly clearer skin and much milder cramps than before.  For the first couple months I did feel a little nauseous sometimes, but that passed.  The only real problem was when I tried to skip a period by not taking the placebo pills and going straight into the next month's active supply.  My pharmacist warned me that I might have some spotting, so I knew it was a gamble, but after a couple days' delay, my period started anyway and spotted heavily for almost three weeks.  Still, this is a 28 day pill and not intended to be taken like that, unlike some of the other brands.

I have been taking Yaz for over a year and I couldn't be happier. Unlike others that have posted, I don't get headaches at all, I actually have no unusual side effects. I started taking it because I have fibroid cysts in my ****. It hasn't completely taken away the cysts, but the pain and swelling are gone. My period is short, cramps aren't bad, and I have NO PMS.  I love it!

I was on a large dose (200 mg per day) right after my shingles started to clear up because I had an episode of sudden, all consuming pain in my face and head. The large dose however, made me unable to drive the most of two months because of sleepiness. Then my doctor reduced the dose to 100 mg per day. I'm still on it, but I'm going to request we take me off because other side effects have become more of a problem than the drowsiness. I'm having trouble with tremors in my hands and dropping things. When I try to dress, my legs jump around all over the place and makes it twice as hard to dress. My knees feel weak and I feel afraid of collapsing. Its getting harder and harder to walk very far because I can't catch my breath. Sometimes when I'm typing, my fingers and hands jump around so bad, it takes twice as long to type anything. I do take several other CNS (central nervous system)affecting meds. These magnify or intensify the Lyrica symptoms. Its been so hard to function on Lyrica

I took this pill for years and loved it.  Got rid of acne and very few side effects.  The thing about all these pills and hormones in general is that your body changes as you get older. What works for you now may change in a few years.  I went of the pill completely for a few years which is why I stopped this one.  When I tried it like 6 years later I had side effects I didn't like so I switched.  Thats just the human body I think... try other things to get what works for you.

I'm in the last 12 days of my third pack. I am switching to Yaz after this pack is up. I went on Lutera to regulate my period and to help control my acne. It has done the exact opposite for me. Months one and three I had spotting and breakthrough bleeding for over half the month, but month two was totally spot and period free. My acne has gotten *way* worse, it sux and right now I'm just waiting for the five more white pills to be done. Every morning when I take it I feel like I'm going against my instincts...

I probably should've known better than to accept free birth control from school. but i haven't even finished the first pack, and it is unreal. My period has come back after 2 weeks of taking it, where it is extremely heavy and painful.

I THANK GOD! that I found this site.  I just left the doctor and he gave me two free sample packs of Yaz and told me to call him if I wanted to switch, ladies I thank you for all of your posts.  I will not be taking YAZ for any reasons. I thought this OC would work because I really suffer from PMS but I think using this pill to cure my PMS will be a mind over matter thing and reading all of the side effects that you have experienced I'll rather deal with the PMS.

No Complaints Here.  I have been on Loestrin 24fe for about three months now, and am very happy with the effectiveness, ease of usage, and basic lack of side effects.  I have never been on another chemical form of birth control, so I have no way of comparing this pill to another - but I am very happy.  I make sure to take the medication each day at noon sharp - an easy enough matter, as I set my cell phone as a personal alarm.  I have suffered no breakthrough bleeding, weight gain or mood swings - if anything, my acne was initially a little more active than before, but has since cleared up.  As far as the cost is concerned, I have to compare it to the amount that my partner and I were spending on condoms - and this is a far better deal - and we feel comfortable with its level of effectiveness.  I would strongly recommend Loestrin 24fe to a friend/family member - I have had no real troubles with it at all.

Switched to Adderall XR (20mg) recently after 9 months on Strattera (80mg) and haven't looked back! Side effects of Strattera were severe (drowsiness, nausea, dry mouth, etc). Adderall XR causes moderate loss of appetite and mild dry mouth, but nothing severe or disruptive. I am usually a rather quiet, reserved person, but I have noticed I am more talkative and less anxious when on this medication. It is potentially addictive, but I can take it only on the days I need to (e.g. on the days I have class), and it takes effect in 30 minutes and lasts about 9 hours -- unlike Strattera, which must be taken every day and takes weeks to become effective. I don't notice any jitteriness at 20mg, and I have no trouble sleeping at night. My productivity SOARS when on this medication! I also notice it makes me feel more calm, and I am a noticeably better (less aggressive) driver on the days I take it. If you have AD/HD I would strongly recommend discussing Adderall or Adderall XR with your doctor.

This drug should only be used on an AS NEEDED basis. I was given this drug when I was 14 for anxiety disorders that had much more to do with my family life than anything wrong with my brain. I was given 2 mg to take daily. I now take 3.5 mg a day, and I have not been able to get off. This medication is highly addictive. If you have anxiety, I reccomend, first: therapy and spiritual journey, second if needed an SSRI (like lexapro etc), then only as a third resort a benzo like Ativan, and only take it AS NEEDED, not continually! Please learn from the mistakes I made! It will lose its effectiveness, and you'll have to keep taking it just to feel the same.  Please read here http://benzo.org.uk/

I took this brand for one year. In that year I gained 25 pounds (I was active in a karate program and pilates, so it wasn't b/c of my lifestyle), my moodswings were atrocious (even when I wasn't PMSing), I still had god awful cramps, I had over 5 yeast infections, and 3 urinary tract infections. I'm not saying that all of this was attributed to this pill, but I can say that I quit taking it over 1 1/2 ago and I haven't had any of these problems since I switched to my current bc (Alesse). I have had friends who have taken it and have had only the weight gain and moodyness side effects. It is different for everyone. However, if you know you are sensitive to medications anyway, or have any of these problems without medication, I highly recommend NOT taking this brand of Birth Control.

I've tried 3 other brands in the past and lo is the one that makes my **** the least swollen and sore.  I have noticed BAD headaches and random crying at the drop of a hat; however, I do have several very stressful things going on in my life.  After 2 months my sex drive has seemed to decrease, but that may be related to my feelings towards by boyfriend.  I was just trying to figure if it was this pill (which is $35 monthly--outrageous!) or just me.  So far it has been effective, but it frightens me that a few people have gotten pregnant while taking it.

Have been on Yaz for 8 months for painful, heavy periods. The first few months had some irregular bleeding problems, but now my periods last one day with minimal cramping! Only side effect I have had  is some loss of libido. My skin has cleared up and I have no PMS! Give this one a try, especially if you have heavy periods, and just make sure you give it at least a few months before you decide if you want to stay on it. It works wonders for the right people.

I had no idea it could be from the pill...I just assumed it was life stress!  Does anyone else find that they now need to use a lubricant for the minimal sex you have on this pill&#63;

This is the worst medication I've ever tried for depression, and I've tried many in the past 14 years.  After an hour or so after taking it I felt like I was going to get sick.  Even worse than that was the horrible hangover it gave me the next day.  It did help me sleep but so do many other medications out there.  It did nothing for my depression and after a few weeks I gave up.

After using Nuvaring for about a year now I have realized that although it is extremely convenient it has been the cause of a lot of problems for me. Side effects have been so horrible that I decided enough is enough and Im switching. Side effects have included, HORRIBLE HORRIBLE hair loss, painful burning sensations similar to bladder infection after sex, zero sex drive, moodiness, depression, vaginal discharge and many others. I recommend anyone to try the ring because its convenience is amazing and it may work for you. But this is a warning because Im reading that the vaginal burning and discomfort during sex is a VERY common side effect. Also, people are saying that hairloss is not a listed side effect but it is. Read the paper that comes in the box and you'll be amazed at all the listed side effects. Good Luck!

Been on 20mg of lexapro for over 4 months now. Has immensely helped with my anxiety but hasn't helped with depression. Doctor upped my dosage to 30 mg and it's making me feel fuzzy and kind of anxious. Called my dr today and they are calling in xanax for me to help me and told me to go back down to 20mg. Afraid to get completely off of it b/c the one time I missed dosage I felt suicidal. The lexapro really really helps with my anxiety which I need b/c I've had severe anxiety problems since I was very little... but I'm not sure what I can do for the depression

I have been on Lutera for about 3 months. I've noticed that I've been getting acne, mood swings, and have had two periods in one month. I feel really sorry for my boyfriend.

I was recently prescribed the Nuvaring.  Fortunately it hasn't made me gain weight, and it has made my face a lot clearer, but like other women I have no sex drive and my vagina burns so much during/after sex that it actually makes me cringe at the thought of having it.  I also feel as if I get very angry at things I normally wouldn't.  I have to switch to something else.

i've been on it for a while, and it truly is a good thing for me. what works for me might not work for you.. it does tend to come out during sex, but it's not that bad. he can feel it, but it doesn't bother him. i haven't had any of the side effects that have been mentioned before, and so far it's never fallen out on me. if you sort of hook it aroung your cervix, it tends to stay better.

I take Alprazolam when I am having anxieties about whatever it may be.  I have anxiety attacks about 4-5 times a year.  And I take the 2mg which people consider to be a lot but I need that much for it to be effective because my anxieties hit me hard.

I have not gotten pregnant on this pill, but I also haven't had much sex either, so I really have no opinion on effectiveness.  The side effects are AWFUL!!!  I vomit every single day and I've been on for 4 months, and usually 1-4 times a day.  I've lost about 10lbs on this (I'm now 5'6 and 98lbs).  The weight loss would be enjoyable if I wasn't sick all the time.  Anything with a smell makes me gag, even if its just fabic softener.  I can only eat small things because filling my stomache brings on horrible bloating and then nausea.  I'm horribly depressed and during active weeks I feel unable to leave my apartment.  I have problems wearing contact lenses.  No sex drive what so ever.  My acne got so much worse, not just on my face but also on my back and chest.  Also, my doctor said since it is a low dose pill, it is very unforgiving, so even a 30 minute time difference in taking the pill you could get pregnant.

I am a crazy person since I started taking Yaz.  My sex drive is non-existant.  It occured to me recently how my I dread sex lately (I was never like that at all).  I'm also dry as a bone down there.  My girlfriend was on these as well but stopped taking them about a month ago.  Everyone keeps telling me I'm sucha **** lately.  My friend keeps saying Stop taking those Yaz, you are so mean!.  The only good thing about them is that my period is so light.  But,I think I will look for another pill or go back to Yasmin.  I don't recall having these carzy side effects on Yasmin

This drug has never worked for me or anyone in my family. We have tried it on numerous occasions for different things and always the original problem is right back at square one on the follow up visit. There have been ocasions when I actually asked the pharmacist if he was giving me the placebo. I now refuse this drug.

The first week i started taking Lutera the side effects werent so great...I was crying for no reason, I had horrible groin pain ( but only lasted for a few hours one day), and just felt weird.  But after that first week I've felt perfectly fine every day since then and I'm on my third month of taking Lutera and its my first time taking an oral contraceptive.  I heard you get less horny taking it, but im still as much as I was before taking it.  The good side effects are tremendously lighter periods and less acne:)

I was on ortho tri-cyclen lo for a little over a year and I have to say it was awful.  I was previously on ovcon and though I had some problems with that one this was so much worse.  I became extremely emotional, basically to the point of depression, gained 12 lbs.  I was getting horrible cramps from it, and I didn't even get cramps when I was on no pill at all.  Experienced heavier periods, migraines and headaches all the time and I completely lost my libido.  Also, just like some girls mentioned if I did not eat by a certain time I would become extremely dizzy and nauseus.  When I had ortho tri-cyclen lo prescribed to me it was with a different doctor than my norm.  When I went back to my normal doctor she said she was very surprised I switched to this pill.  She told me she had rec'd many complaints about it.  I am finally off and just switched to YAZ.  She advised that she has had great feedback from yaz and an average weight LOSS of 2lbs.  I hope this one is better!

I started taking this for heavy periods and cramps. I basically first had my period for 22 days, I called my doctor and they said to stop the pack and start again. I was fine for about a week but then my period came back in the middle of the pack. I couldnt take it anymore! No girl deserves to be on their period for a month almost! im switching to ortho tri cyclen lo and im hoping for the best. I was a bit moody but everything else was fine.

Being on this type of birth control has completely eliminated my sex drive I feel like.  It kind of saddens me that this has happened, but I don't want to have a child yet so that's why I am on it.

This terrible drug made my father go crazy! He slept for an hour, got up, and would act like a lunatic all night, and he wouldn't remember a thing! He would fall and trip over himself, he would say that I wasn't his daughter, he would stare at me and threathen to****me! Last week, his behavior frightened me so badly I called my boyfriend at 3 am crying hysterically, he came by and called an ambulance...After a week in the hospital, I threw his pills out of the window. I never want to see those pills in my house again!

I have been on this for six months.  People comment that you bleed if you do not take it at the same time every day.  If you want any pill to be effective that is the case.  Take it at the same time and the problem lessens.  I had problems on ortho-tri.  Had a baby in March and my fantastic doctor thought this would be the best option for me.  There are side effects for every pill.  In terms of weight gain, I had none.  I lost my baby weight due to exercise and watching my diet.  This pill has been great for me.

I was on Lutera for 10 days without noticing anything and then day 10 I snapped. Rage and grief like I haven't had since several years ago when I was taking some other pill that totally messed me up emotionally. I've been tired, bloated and yeasty, but imagined that was all from other causes. I'm not pregnant, but I'm not interested in sex, another side-effect I'm guessing. I know there have been cases of serious accidents linked to PMS and this pill makes me feel like I could do real hormonally-induced damage. Thankfully I remembered the incident with that other pill I was taking a few years ago and stopped it immediately. I'm going back to Yasmine  which was GREAT, but more expensive. Or maybe I'll give lower-dose Yaz a try.

I started taking it after having tried Adderall. I LOVE strattera. I have zero side effect and I don't have to get the landing when the medication effect expires. It doesn't work on the hyperactivity (and that's why I like it) but does work on mood swings and inattention. I've never been more serene, fullfilled and able to do just about everything I care doing.

I hate this pill! i advise no one to take ortho tri_cyclen. It has made me so depressed i am a wreck. i have the worst mood swings in the world, and now i have to go see a therapist. i have been on it for 5 months , for the first month i was fine then after the second i started having anxiety after the third the mood swings came and i was down all the time after the fourth every thing just got wors and now i cry at least twotimes a day. my relationship with people as with  the way i feel about myself has been affected in the most negative ways. i am changing it this week and hope for the best as well as hope that the person who is reading this doesnt make the decision to use ortho-tricyclen.

Before I took YAZ, my periods were decently long (6 days) so my gyno recommended YAZ to shorten them a bit. I also never had any severe PMS symptoms just slight cramping and a few breakouts on my face. Once I took YAZ tho my emotions went all over the place. I've been flipping out on the people I love the most and have been crying all the time for no reason. From looking at everyone else's reviews I think if you do not have severe PMS or PMDD do not take YAZ.. look for another low hormone pill. This pill seems to bring out the worst in women who normally get through their periods just fine. I gave a 3 for effectiveness because although I've been an emotional mess, I didn't get pregnant the 4 months I was on it. A happy life totally makes up for a longer period.

The first several months on this pill were fine. Then i started spotting and had the worst cramps accompanied by cold sweats and dizziness. I already had bad menstrual cramping but to have them when i wasnt even on my period was no fun.I usually took some advil for menstrual cramps and it works fine. But this time it didn't work and I was in constant pain for 24hrs. I had to call in sick to work because of it cause I could barely stand. My doctor has said she's seen the same side effects with other women. Something to do with the low hormones causes it. I am now taking ortho-novum which has a higher dosage of hormones. Still waiting to see how it works out.

Hello Everyone.  I just started taking YAZ 11 days ago.  My doctor told me to start taking it the Sunday after my period starts and what do you know, my period started Sunday, Sept. 30th.  It seemed as if I had a regular period of 5 days but after that I have been spotting brown since-- normally in the afternoon which is really weird.  I am 25 years old and this is my first time taking bc.  I was prescribed for YAZ for my long (6 day) periods and PMDD symptoms.  I have never spotted a day of my life until now.  I consistently take my pill at 830 am everyday.  I had nausea on the first day but that was it, my appetite has curved and a little bit of an acne breakout.  I haven't had any mood changes.  I just dont want to continue bleeding for the rest of the month because it makes me feel like giving up and I am trying to last for the 3 months. I have been reading all of your comments and wondering if anyone else had similar side effects.  If so when did they end and are you still using&#63;

I've been trying to find the right bcp to take continuously (to stop my periods altogether) and this one was just one on my list that my insurance covers. My gyno gave me a sample of Femcon Fe (which I guess is the same thing). It's a chewable pill, so that's nice, but for me this pill is horrible.  On week 2 of the active pills I bled until week 3. I've broken out with some horrible acne and for the past 3 days, I've had migraines. The only times I've ever had migraines or bad acne has been while taking the wrong bcp. I used to take Lo-Ovral for continuous use, but after children for some reason, Lo-Ovral started giving horrible acne, much worse than Ovcon-35/Femcon Fe. I'll keep on trying. Lybrel is the newest bcp approved for 365-year use, but at this time, it's not covered by my insurance.

I've been taking 75mg daily for Chronic Orchialgia (Testicular nerve pain)  If I had to guess I would say it cuts some of the pain.  It might be the dose I'm taking that makes it ineffective&#63;  Side effects are bad for me.  Weird mental confusion.  It makes me feel high and I wake up tired and have that droopy eye I'm on drugs feeling.  I don't care for it.

Works well if you have never used benzodiazepines regularly. It is very habit-forming and stops being effective if used too often. Makes you very drowsy, but can be extremely useful for panic attacks.

i've only been on lutera for about 9-10 days, so i can't say how effective it is quite yet - i can only really tell you about the side effects. i had horrible side effects the first week. the nausea was almost constantly there, making me want to vomit, so i couldn't really eat properly or at all.  that wasn't the worst part though- the depression that came with lutera was horrible. i cried and was extremely moody for many days straight. i've also had a moderate/bad breakout (acne), and have been a little dizzy and a little spacey. i haven't had any spotting (yet). however, after a little more than a week, i can say that everything seems to be normal again. if my side effects are really all gone after a week, i will probably keep using it.  i've been feeling a lot better...so maybe the side effects (that come with every bcp, keep in mind) only happen in the beginning, and is worth it in the long run (IMO).overall i'm satisfied for now. i may rate this again in a couple of months. GL! :)

I am not alone...YAZ is not a miracle pill for everyone, certainly not me.  I have never been so depressed or uninterested in sex my entire life.  Since the week I started taking YAZ I have been emotionaly unstable and compleltely unlike my usual happy optimistic self.  I knew something was up.  This site should be what the doctors tell you to go to if you want an actual idea of what a pill can be like.  The thought that I could have stayed on this pill and delt with its symptoms any longer truely makes me sick to my stomach..  I have thrown them away and will never look back.  Talk about a nightmare.  Those who this pill actually HELPS are the lucky ones.

I have been on Yaz for about 5 months, and have had SO many negative side effects-- my sex drive has gone down, I have lossed major amounts of hair, and have had REALLY bad breakouts.  This has never been an issue before when taking birth control, and I have had nothing but problems.  Luckily, I went to another doctor (since my last said it had nothing to do with the pill), and she solved the problem by switching me.  DO NOT CHANCE IT with the Yaz.

This drug have improved my life 1000x.  My only complaint is testicular atrophy which happens with most men on HRT.  *Note testosterone levels under 400 should be looked into if you have symptoms.  Anything under 325 (If I remember right) is treatment indicated.  Read the 2002 AACE guidelines for more info.  Don't use 1998 lab numbers anymore!!!!

Depo Provera is one of the greatest things to ever happen to me. I got pregnant while taking the Pill, as do about 1-8% of Pill users in the first year of use. Further, while on the Pill I ****d about every 3 weeks with heavy bleeding that lasted for about 6 days. I have now been on Depo for about 3 years. I have not since gotten pregnant. Unlike the Pill, Depo Provera has a failure rate of 3 in 1000; that is, in the first year of use only 3 out of 1000 women get pregnant. (see www.plannedparenthood.org for statistics that I have mentioned) During the 1st year, I bled less and less until I stopped bleeding completely! This happens to the majority of Depo users. Compared to the extremely difficult to follow regimen of taking the Pill at the same time every day, Depo Provera every 3 months is wonderful! And I don't have a bloody mess to deal with every month either!

I've been taking Lexapro almost two years.  You must give it time. (A good 1 to 3 months)  It's not a quick fix.  No longer do I feel I would be better off dead.  I use to hate, hate, hate.  No more pissy, grumpy moods.  I have better concentration.  It makes life for me easier.

Yaz is a nightmare! Yes, it made my skin clearer, but every other part of me seems to be falling apart: heartburn, huge sore chest, nausea, fatigue, dry mouth/bad taste in my mouth, bloating..you name it, I've got it.

I have taken this pill for 2 months and I am now on my 3rd package. This pill has made be nausous every single morning since I started to take it. I thought it would get better once I got used to the hormones but it has not. I feel exactly like morning sickness when you are pregnant except this is much worse than when I was pregnant. I was hoping this pill would help with my moderate acne but I have actually gotten some of the largest most painful acne since I stared this pill. When I get my periods they are just as heavy as when I was not on Birth control but I have much more cramping that last the entire period. And even after the my main period is over I have about an extra 3-5 days of random spotting. I have gained about 2-3 lbs since taking this pill and I think it is mostly because I try to keep my stomach full so I dont feel like vomiting as much. I have not experience any strang moods or emotions but my sex drive is almost zero. I simply just dont think about sex anymore.

I have tried most of the anti-depressants out there and this is the only one that has really worked. I have been on this 2 years now and I am terrified to ever go off. I started taking it more for anxiety and panic more so then depression. It really has alleviated alot of the panic and anxiety I used to experience on a daily basis. I have noticed some weight gain but its a small trade off for the benefit of feeling normal that it has given me. I do find it is NOT a good thing to even miss one dose as I get a very strange headache. Its only happened twice and won't happen again. After trying everything out there, this really has been a blessing. I was a bit nervous about trying this one because I had heard it had bad side effects, I'm glad I gave it a go, because I am much happier then ever before.

Am up to 150mg 3x a day, so far none of the side effects that others complain of, no weight gain, and improved function. I do have blurred vision from time to time.

Ive been on adderall for ten years.I do not like it at all.It helps me a little in school but I have so many problems with it.Can't sleep,can't eat,maybe a little snack at night and thats it for sometimes 2 days at a time.Have severe mood swings.Causes mild aggression between my family and friends.On a good night I may go to bed at like 12:00 or 1:00 and have to get up at five.It is really addictive I think I need it every day and I question my self do I really need this medicine or not.I would prefer any one out there taking adderall 30 mg.xr try to find a solution without having to take adderall for the same reasons I am; and please write back to this website.I am to scared to ask for help about this medicine from my friends and family even though adderall 30 mg. xr. is prescribed to me.I've lost 10-15 pounds in three weeks.and have not weighed over 145 in the past 2-3 years.And Im 5'8 and 18 years of age.I would prefer nobody to take adderall.I have went from 10mg-30mg.xr

Does NOT cause dizziness, and does not lead to addiction. (some people can get addicted to anything) Have taken it for years, yet have stopped for several nights during vacations, etc. and never experienced any sort of craving or rebound insomnia. My doctor says I can take it for life if necessary and I believe him. It's better to take this pill and get into bed right away and try to sleep, you'll never remember feeling drowsy -- just wake up in the morning feeling rested and alert. Make sure you take it 7 hours before you want to get up! I've never experienced any sort of taste perversion with it, but I think the benefits of this drug far outweigh any side effects. If your doctor won't prescribe a sleep med, ask to be referred to a psychiatrist -- many people have sleep disorders and many GPs are ill-equipped to recognize this.

I have suffered from migranes since I was 9yo (over 32yrs).  Zomig has been a God-send.  My sister also suffers from them (more hormonal induced) and she too gets relief from Zomig.  Both of us experience all over joint aches and dry mouth from it.  I also experience a lot of mucle ache in my throat/neck and back of tongue.  However, both my sister and I feel that the relief from the migraines far outweighs the flue-like side effects that last one day.  I wish that Zomig wasn't so expensive: 6 pills for $230-$250 w/o medical insurance.  It would be nice if they made it more reasonable especially since so many suffer from migraines.  Even w/ insurance, you are only allowed 5-6 pills w/in a 30-day period and if I have a bad month, I can get up to 7 migraines per month.  As far as I'm concerned, Zomig is a WONDER drug!

I take Ambien occasionally, and it makes me fall asleep within 30 minutes if I actually lie down and turn the lights off.  I can fight it, stay awake, have conversations i won't rememeber in the morning.  I need to make sure my phone is in another room when I take Ambien, becuase I have been known to make incoherent phone calls and send incoherent text messages to confused friends. All of this can be eliminated by me just turning out the light and going to bed within 20 minutes of taking Ambien.

I was taking Yasmin for a while and couldn't have been happier,but I lost insurance so I switched to Lutera a couple of months ago. I wish I new these syptoms before I tried it. When I first started this I was vomiting like crazy, now I know why!! It's effective since I am not pregnant, but I have had horrible headaches,I gained 7 pounds, my **** are sooo sore and I have had cramps even in the first 2 weeks of my packet. And worse of all I have been suffering with severe depression for over a month also. I didn't know these side effects, and I am going to stop taking this today. Good luck to everyone else!

THIS PILL IS GARBAGE... COMPLETE CRAP!  I gave it a 3 for effectiveness because I really dont know how effective it is.  I'm a guy and just rating this based on my wife's symptoms that I can see. (she has already switched).  About 2 weeks in she became annoyed with everything I did, I'd cook dinner and buy flowers and it would annoy her.  No sex drive whatsoever, from having sex 3-5 times a week to 1 time every 2 weeks or so.  Didn't help her mild acne.  She was also extremely depressed at times.  All this time I had no idea she had even switched to this drug and thought it was something I had done, I was going insane trying to figure out what I could have possibly done.  IF you try this pill which I do NOT suggest, please for your boyfriend/husbands sake let him know you are switching so he dosn't pull his hair out wonder what he did to piss you off.

Tonight I started searching the internet for answers as to why I am emotionally out of control!  Clearly, I have been feeling the horrible emotional side effects of Yaz- like most of these postings.  I'm relieved to read some postings that relate to the horrible crying, crazy emotions while taking yaz.  I've been on yaz for a few months, and was starting to assume I had mental problems.  My boyfriend had that look on his face this morning that he just can't take it anymore - because we spent the weekend fighting with my uncontrollable crying spells (about nothing). If I don't stop taking Yaz asap, I'm going to lose my mind and my awesome boyfriend.  Now that I'm aware of this, I'm starting to recall all sorts of mood changes and odd emotional behaviors over the past few months.  I'm done with Yaz.

I have been on Nuva Ring for a month now. I used to be crazy about sex before but now, it seems as though my sex drive has diminished.  Oh and not to mention...the terrible pain it causes after sex.  It burns terribly bad and is sore for a couple of days after intercourse.  I also have been experiencing some acne.  Other than that, I have not gained any weight and my boyfriend does not feel it during intercourse.  I am changing birth control.  DO NOT USE NUVA RING!

I have been on this for about two years now and until I read some of the comments on here, I didn't think that I had any side effects.  I have noticed that my skin is extremely dry, I always feel bloated, I am depressed all the timme (which is not me at ALL!), and I have no sex drive at all.  I never thought that it could have been from my birth control but since so many more people on the same drug are having the same problems then it seems like this is the factor.

This was the worst thing I've ever done to myself. I literally wanted to walk into traffic two days after I was administered this shot and it continued for probably 4 months. My sex drive was completely gone (haha- that's how it really works!) and I was very mean to everyone. I gained about 10 lbs and spotted throughout the second month. Bad for me-- my family freaked out when I told them I was going to get shot #2....totally kidding though. I got on Lutera...much better. My advice...don't do it! The convenience is great, but it's so not worth it.

It works well. I was reading some of these posts and some of you didnt take it long enough. Others probably dont have ADHD in the first place. Others Change your diet.            Strattera has had a strong effect on me. I have been on and off it for about 3 years. When insurance allows. I have gone cold turkey to the full 60Mg dose and the side effects are minimal. It feels to me like my body and mind are Focusing. I feel like something missing has been found. The nausea is mild and the loss of appetite is mild. No headaches or Ringing in my ears. All in all it is a good pill. I tried Adderal. IT made me crash. Yes the Zombie effect is normal for the adjusment period and will last longer if you are doing the step in period.

I have to say that Darvocet is like taking a couple of extra strength tylenol's. I have fibromyalgia, sjogren's, and a very bad back, and Darvocet did absolutely nothing! I also don't see how anyone could become dependent on such a medication. Doctors need to realize, some people do need REAL treatment for pain. Not just a pretty brightly colored pill with a narcotics name on the bottle. Some of us appreciate good pain medication, and we don't abuse it either!!!! If your in real pain, your less likely to become addicted. So I hear. The bottom line is, don't waste your time looking for relief with Darvocet, your better off taking tylenol. Good Luck

I haven't been on this drug for very long yet, but so far have had no major problems.  I have had none of the usual side effects (though one day I felt a little nauseous but realized I hadn't eaten yet that day.)  The only thing I've noticed since taking the pill is I am much less hungry than I used to be (a good thing) and I feel more tired than usual.  Other than that no problems.  A little expensive for one with no insurance, but So far it is working well for me.

I have been on this drug for the past 3 months...The last 2..I have been a complete mess. i decided to switch to this pill because of my previous weight gain...and all i got from this was extreme depression, a non-existant sex drive, and mood swings...Since I started..I have been getting my period every 2 weeks and they would last me a week and a half..I do not recoment this to anyone..but then again, it all has a different effect on the individual..mine..HORRIBLE!!

I am 48 and have been taking YAZ for nearly 6 months. It has helped tremendously w/PMS, PMDD symptoms and I have not experienced any pill side effects such as breast tenderness, bloating, weight gain, nausea, or anything.  The only concern I have is that I experience anxiety & panic attacks during the 4 pill free days & that is awful. I have skipped the pill free days twice now to avoid this problem & that helped. It caused minor spotting, but that is better than the anxiety symptoms.

I have been on this pill for about 4 months.  The first month I came on my period while I still had 5 active pills left and I would wake up spotting until I took the pill.  My period lasted about 5 days.  The next month, I came on my period with 7 active pills left and it lasted a day.  I was left wondering if I was going to have another period on my in-active pill days.  This month...I have not had a period at all but I am constantly crampy and my discharge is heavy as if I am about to come on my period.  I am going to get a pregnancy test because I am not sure what the heck is going on!!  I am seriously thinking about going back to a 21/7 cycle pill.  At least I knew when my period was coming.  I would not recommend this pill to an older woman.  I have been on the pill before but I have noticed that since I have been in my 30's my body reacts differently.  I think I need something with a little more hormones.

This drug is not nearly as wonderful as it seems. I experienced a lot of weight gain (pretty quickly too) due to an increased appetite, as well as periods that last for weeks. The one and ONLY good thing about this shot is that you do not have to think about it everyday. However, if i had known i would have my period everyday instead i would have gladly stayed on the pill.

I took Ortho Lo for years-then switched to the nuva ring. Which is much more convienant, but super expensive. So I came back to Lo after 2 years being off birth control completely. I'm on my first pack of pills, only 2 weeks in, and I'm nausious every time I eat. I'm wondering if anyone else has felt this way&#63; My insurance doesn't cover this, only regular ortho-so the value for me is bad. Convenience comparitively to the Nuva Ring- hard to remember to take a pill after only having to change a ring one a month.

I have been on this pill for four years and at first it was great. My acne which was not much, disappeared, and didnt come back and I had no gain in weight. I also was not moody. However in the past year, I have began to gain weight and am very moody. I am not sure wether or not this has anything to do with this pill, but after reading other peoples blogs on it, I wonder if it does.

I thought I was the only one that were having issues when switched to Balziva after being told by the pharmicist that they had discontinued Ovcon.  I was on Ovcon since 2001 and had none of the side effects that I have now.  I frequently have mood swings.  I have also had spotting and irregular periods these few months that I have been on Balziva. I also noticed a remarkable weight gain of at least 15 lbs in the last 6 months.  I plan on stopping this pill very soon.

While I continue to take this drug, I am not a fan.  It is prohibitively expensive, and very inconvenient. Even though I have been on it for about five years, I still occasionally get 'brain shocks' for no reason. If I miss my dose by more than an hour or two, the brain shocks will inevitably occur.  This is nothing compared to what it's like to stop taking this medication all together. I am physically addicted to it.  DO NOT take this medication unless absolutely necessary.

I was on Toprol twice for extended periods. At a high enough dose it did bring down my blood pressure but both times I gained over 20 pounds (lost while off it) and had no energy while taking it.

I have been taking Effexor XR for 3 years.  I'm not sure it has done anything, exept make me fear missing a dose.  Once I forgot 3 days and I thought I was loosing my mind.

My son had huge mood swings in the first few weeks  on strattera. Anger,crying, sadness. This started within the first five weeks of taking Strattera, it definitely became less after those first few weeks but was still more elevated than before the medication. He had frequent headaches and stomach aches. He did seem be more attentive most of the time but would have days when it seemed ineffective. After about 6 months on Strattera his pediatrician noticed, during a sick visit, that he had not grown (height or weight) in the 8 months. She suggested we take him off the medication, or psychiatrist agreed. So now he is off it and the emotional stuff is still there so now it is hard to say if this was just something that has started because of the strattera or if it is just something he would have developed anyway. So now we are back to figuring out what next&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63; Good luck to anyone reading this, it is a tough road!!

I took Kariva for a few years before switching to Loestrin.  I never had break-through bleeding or a missed period on Kariva.  Since taking Loestrin for the last 7 months, I have experienced break-through bleeding twice and one missed period.  I also feel more tense and fatigued.  I called my doctor and have switched back to Kariva.  I would rather deal with a longer period than all the side effects I experienced with Loestrin.

Have only been on Adderall xr for 2 months, the first month was great except the crash in the evening when it wore off...the 2nd month though is a different story, the crash is much more severe this month and i feel a HUGE ammount of anger, mood swings, and server irritability.  It is to the point where I worry about myself getting angry with my children and my wife has noticed it a great deal.  It works well for my ADD, but the side effects make it not worth it.  I think I will try Concerta and see how that works, I have heard it has similar benefits, with less side effects.

I was on this for I think 2-3 months, Ive been struggling with Birth Control for awhile. This one made me nauseas, I think the first night I vomitted continously all thru the night. I lost all sex drive, not exactly what I wanted, i want sex without pregnancy! It's been awhile since Ive been on B.C. but this one wasnt going well at all. It didnt really make me moody, more irritated and no sex drive, and when i did have sex it made me kinda dry. I wont go back to it.

I was on Ortho Tri-Cylcen for a few years. It really helped me skin. My periods were not painful at all (normally I get bad cramps). I switched, because I was having issues with spotting. Now I'm on Lutera. Now, I don't have perfect skin, I'm an emotional wreck, I have bad cramps, and I still have spotting. Going to the Doctor to change back to Ortho Tri-Cyclen as soon as I can.

I took depo for about 4 straight years and I can say that the shot does work very effectively as long as you get your follow-up shots in time. Also, I lost my periods completely for a lovely 4 years with no spotting. Although I cannot pin 100% of the changes I experienced while on it to the drug, I experienced weight gain - went from 110 to 150, I've always had bad skin and it didn't affect my skin at all, it also completely extinguished my sex drive. Since stopping Depo, for 7.5 months I continued to have no periods and then suddenly, I started getting periods for 4-6 days every 2 weeks or so, which has been pretty miserable. Overall, Depo is great, but you shouldn't be on it long-term - particularly because of the risk for bone damage.

I was on Adderall for a brief period and found it helpful. My only gripe was it gave me a bad taste in my mouth and the capsule would start to disolve in my mouth the second I put it in so it tasted yucky. The capsule is full of small balls (salts).

Only good for short term insomnia i.e. maybe a week to ten days. This stuff literally leaves a bitter taste in your mouth for a whole day afterwards.  Even if  you take half a 7.5 mg pill.

Just started taking Yaz this month. I decided to start the Sunday after my period began, to try to keep my periods in sync and not throw my system off completely. The only side effects so far are slight nausea and constant bloated sensation. I am retaining more water and it feels uncomfortable. However, my clothes fit the same so I must not be gaining any noticeable weight. I try to curve the nausea by taking the pill at night so I am sleeping while it is processed in my system. This seems to help. Anyone else feel bloated all the time&#63;

I am in love with this pill! I have been on it for 4 months.  No period!! It's a little unnerving not knowing if I did get pregnant or not, but it's nothing that a few bucks on a pregnancy test cna't solve. I also love that you have to take this every day instead of those stupid pills that you stop taking for a week. I love this pill, the end result is great and ALL pills have their quirks, but this one works for me.

I took Zoloft for depression and anxiety. The only feeling worse than depression is mental numbness, and that is all I felt on this drug.

I've been on Loestrin 24 for about 8 months. I hate this BCP and I've been on them all over the years. About a week before the last pill I start bleeding, so I end up with a period that lasts a week and a half every month. Pretty much defeats the purpose of a 24 day pill, and is longer than my periods were on the 21 day regime. Can't wait to get a different prescription. (And yes I take it at the same time every day, and never miss a day).

Trazodone has always worke for me, but I just now figured out a better way to take it.  It takes 2.5 hours to make me sleepy, but when I get sleepy I am definetely ready for bed.  It works best with food, and for me anyway with exercise after taking the tablet.  It is difficult to get off Trazodone without withdrawl's, but all I have to do is slowly reduce the amount down to zero and I am free of the drug.  It also cured my frequent urination at night and in the day problem!  Feel much more relaxed from the very deep sleep that Trazodone offers.

I've been on Lutera for a month now, and the only side effect I've experienced has been a longer period. I used to have a heavy, 3-5 day period but now it's come a week early and has been much lighter (and hasn't stopped yet). From what my OBGYN said and from what I've read this is normal for the first 3 months. No weight gain or moodswings so far, and only the occasional headache, though that may just be from outside stress, lol

THE BEST!  No more pills to remember every day, no more patches to gum up your skin every week!  You only need to insert a comfortable plastic ring ONCE A MONTH - and neither you nor your partner will feel it!  Great for women on the go.  I CHALLENGE ANYONE WHO THINKS HER BIRTH CONTROL IS CONVENIENT TO TRY THIS.  It comes with all kinds of props like stickers for your date book and an electronic timer that beeps at the end of the month to remind you to change your ring.

i was on yasmin for about a year and a half and it was a nightmare.  I had chest pains, mood swings, crying all the time, hair loss, and bad cramps.  the only good part was i didnt gain weight, and no acne. so i switched to ortho lo.  nightmare.  I have ALWAYS been an extremly happy person.. always witha  smile on my face and the first to befriend someone.  I feel so bad for my family and boyfriend now bc i get so mad out of nowhere and i can start to cry at the drop of a dime.  I hate myself. This pill has made me feel like my life is going nowhere and i cant stand being so mad and grouchy all the time.  I just want the old meback with the same effectiveness.. and ive always had a high sex drive.  Yasmin didnt effect that .. but with ortho low, i feel nothing.  I want to switch but with no insurance its kind of hard.  I want to try yaz but heard it was off the wall expensive. anyone kno how much&#63;

Terrible. This drug is what doctors perscribe when they are scared to give you stimulants. Its hard to concentrate in class-if you pass out!

Thank you so much for your postings.  I thought I was going crazy.  I've had horrible, daily headaches for about 3 months.  I finally made the connection between Yaz and the headaches because of this website.  I've also been feeling numb about life and have lost interest in doing many activities that I normally enjoy.  These side effects are so scary because for me they were gradual.  Now that I've stopped the pill 2 days ago my headaches are better (not as painful) and I'm bouncing back emotionally.  Yesterday was actually one of the first days that I didn't NEED an afternoon nap in months.  I truly advise anyone thinking of this pill to talk to your doctor before trying it!

I have taken Zoloft for four months now.  I just started taking the new generic.  It honestly took it to fully work for me about 3 months.  I felt better at first, but not great.. then three months after I started taking it my anxiety was almost completely gone.  I can go through the day with ought worrying about every little thing.  I take 75 mg, and I was about to ask my doctor to up my dose, but glad I did not, because now 75 mg works for me.  The only side effect I do not like, but can live with is I can go with out sex and not miss it, but when I do have an orgasm it is MUCH better.. so I guess this is a good but bad side effect.

My Father had very bad nerve pain from his sciatic nerve, arthritis in his back and also recovering from his 3rd hip replacement.  Almost immediately after first taking it, Lyrica has done wonders for him - he is a new man at age 75.  We highly recommend to at least try this drug if you have nerve pain.

same college student here from comments below. i am now done with the first week of pills and i really dont see any noticeable side effects. i think there might have been some minor bloating the first 2 days but other than that, everything has been great. i actually noticed an increase in vaginal lubrication, but then i again, i usually do have a lot. as for my libido, it hasnt been affected negatively. my libido might have gone up because of the diminished worries about pregnancy- still have that same great desire =). i havent had any spotting or cramps. again, its only been my first week (white pills). [no nausea or vomitting at all] going to keep posting as college student

This pill gave me yeast infections EVERY SINGLE MONTH that I was on it, and I was on it for a year. I hadn't had an infection in years before I started this pill.

I was on the Nuva ring for a year and loved it. I would sometimes have pain during sex but it wasn't too bad. A little after a year of being on it i started having pain during sex all the time, i was always dry and my sex drive pretty much disappeared. I've been constantly sick and my allergies have been so bad. I sleep more than i ever have in my life and I'm always in a 'blah' mood, im never happy. I have gained 25 pounds since i first started the ring. All i have to say is that over the last year alot of weird things have happened to me and im starting to connect them all to be side effects of the ring. Watch out

This ring is way underated. I have used it for over a year, absolutely no side effects. Sometimes i would forget that its even in. Those stickers are a great help to remind you when to take out or put in. My husband did not feel it at all.

Good value since it is now generic.  I changed from Effexor to Zoloft and it was a miracle.  The depression subsided and the instability went away.  I am Bipolar II and am able to take this.

I have been on Yaz for 5 months.  It's really evened out my moods during the month so that I don't even notice my period is coming by my mood, the only way I know is by where I am in my pack.  Subtle changes occurred like a slight weight gain (2-3 pounds) my craving for certain foods decreased while others increased, and my period is super light.  I'm on it for ovarian cysts which is has cured, and also helped clear up all pimples and skin issues.  I haven't lost any hair as some report.  I get more monthly headaches and they're stronger now, my gyno recommended Seasonique instead to cut headaches but I'm not done with Yaz, it's been good to me so far overall.

I am 47 and had been experiencing perimenopauseal symptoms the worst being severe mood swings,crying,anger &depression. My doctor wanted to perscribe anti-depressants, but I wanted to get to the root of the problem.I tried natural soy,exercise,herbs. I saw a slight improvement. My doctor then put me on estrogen patch and over the last yr & 1/2 I have taken 5 birthcontrol. While taking them many symptons and migraine headaches. Nothing worked. My moods were where I avoided friends, family, I quit activities I normally enjoyed. I researched PMS & found those who had PMS/PMDD in 20's could possibly see it return in Perimenopause. I thank God for YAZ! I have been on YAZ for 3 months & ALL symptoms have disappeared. Only side effect is a low libido but my husband &I agree my sanity is most important & we can work out the sex. I encourage women who are in their 40’s and are experiencing PMS/perimenopauseal symptoms ask your doctor about YAZ. It worked for me!

I have been on lutera for 8 days now and usually my periods last about 4 days...i am STILL on my period (for 8 days).  is this a big deal&#63;  has anyone else shared this same problem&#63;  i just dont know if i need to call anyone or just wait it out.  other than that complaint--i have experienced no other bad side effects really (first time using birth control too!)

I have been on this pill for 7 mos for heavy and crampy periods.  The first few months were great. However, as time went on the cramps came back and the duration of period is gradually getting longer. A little moody toward the end of the pack, other than that no other side effects

I have been on the pill for 2 years... I liked it, no problems at all.. little or no period, takes some time to get used to.. but i switched to tri cyclen lo just to see what another pill was like.. i tried sesonal before and HATED it.. I guess I have to wait to see which of the 3 is better.. but this pill is all in all great!

i started the ring after going from pill to pill and constantly having break thru bleeding.  so far, i have had no break thru bleeding, which has been a huge relief!  the first couple of months i had some burning and itching down there, but it seems to be getting better.  i think that it sucks that we have to struggle to find some kind of hormonal birth control....but this is a ok one out of all the annoying choices.

I switched from Desogen to Lutera 4 months ago b/c of the side effects. Compared to D, Lutera has far less consequences, but now i'm weepy all the time. I don't get spotting, weight gain, dizziness, or nausea, but i do feel depressed all the time and kind of empty/numb.  Lately my moods have been ridiculous and i've been getting angry/sad at the most ridiculous things. Since i started taking OC's 5 months ago, i've become much more emotional and sensitive. (btw it doesn't cure acne.) It could be a part of growing up (i'm 19) or it's the pills. My depression is driving me and my bf crazy but latex hurts like no other, and Planned Parenthood gave me a year's worth of pill packs... :/ what to do...

I use this drug for PTSD from Vietnam.  For me it works great.  Prior to taking it I wasn't very nice to be around. Mine is supplied by the Veterans Administration and it is a generic - sertraline hcl.  Take 200mg daily which is the max dose and have had NO side effects. Never been as calm since 1966 as I have been for the past two years. No more nightmares or flashbacks. GREAT STUFF!

Totaly got rid of my panic disorder and since I am disabled due to heart damage caused by a chemotherapy drug it keeps me from going stir crazy and getting depressed.  It's hard to say if Lexapro or my low testosterone level are the major causes for my low sexual drive but I still seem to have minimal ED problem during sex.  It definetly has changed my life for the positive.  It does have the weirdest withdraw affect I have experienced though.  When I don't take it for a day or two I have very strange dreams and sleep excessively.  The few times I was off it a more than 2 days I was extremely agitated.

I'm 16 and am on my 12th pill therefore I can't really say how effective the pill is for me. Within the past week and a half I've noticed my depression increasing greatly to points where I don't want to get out of my bed, see anyone or do anything. I feel sick random parts of the day and I get a lot of headaches since I started the pill. I feel like it has a lot of downfalls but the only thing I really care about is its effectiveness, I guess it's okay for now.

First off let me say that I think I was one of the few women who got a defective ring.  I was fine on it for about 4 months and I had been doing the no period cycle.  Out of no where I started bleeding extrememly heavily.  Cramps were extremely painful.  I think I may have had a miscarriage.  I'm waiting on blood work to confirm as we speak.  I'm hoping that it's just a defective ring b/c I really liked this product.  It's easy to use, never fell out.  But I was suprised at the number of women who got pregnant while on it.  I'm wondering if they were the ones that took it out during sex.  I know it says you can do that, but I never did.....Good luck to those who use it.. I probably just had a bad ring, but I plan on still using it

I've been on Yaz for... a year and three months now.  About the third month I had some side effects.  Those lasted about a month, but they weren't severe.  I feel fine now and I love Yaz.  No weight gains or anything, less acne, and the shorter periods are nice too.  I don't have a problem with it.

I've been using Lutera for two and a half weeks now and I can honestly say I've had very little trouble with it. The first couple of days I took it I felt a little out of it and headaches. I take it in the evening and all of my side effects were gone by morning. Now that it's been a couple weeks, I don't feel the side effects anymore. I also think it helps if you eat around the time you take the pill. Overall, I'd say Lutera is great!

this pill is awesome.  I took other pills and they all made me so sick.  This was like my last hope and it is great.  I haven't experienced any side effects at all and since it is such a low hormone pill that its a really great option for younger people.

I've been on Depo for more than 2 years.  I had bleeding and spotting for the first 3 shots (9 months) but after that I've only had very rare spotting.  I'm very happy to not have my period, but I've gained at least 20 pounds.  I don't think I gained any weight in the first 6 months, but in the second year, I went from a size 9 to a size 13.  All the weight is in my belly, which sometimes freaks me out and makes me think I could be pregnant (with no way of knowing because there is no period).  Also, it definately makes me crave sugary, fatty foods all the time, which is why I've gained weight.  Also, I've been doing very hard manual labor with a landscaping job that I do for 8 hours a day (for the last month) and I have not lost ANY weight.  If I work all day and only eat some fruit, I might lose a pound of water weight for a day or so, but then it comes back.  So I'm very happy about how effective it is, and not getting periods, but not losing the weight with vigorous excercise sucks.

I've been on OTC Lo for about a year now. The only time I've ever had any side effects was in the first two weeks to where I was constantly nauseated. As far as clearing my skin up, NOPE! Still the same...but my sex drive is great. No big complaints!

This works great for sinusitis; I took this drug for years before it was no longer effective. It will cure you of the problem temporarily, At first I took it every 6 months, Then it was every couple of months, then it would only cure me for about one month, And after about five years The drug was no longer effective. Augmentin is the only antibiotic effective on sinusitis because of the clavulanate potassium mixed with it.However it is expensive if you do not have insurance.

I have been suffering with headaches for over 10 yrs.Been on every otc and narcotic pain meds that were available.They all worked at best moderate and thats being generous.Finally I got a doctor who really listened to me and my symptoms.I am taking 10mg of methadone 3x daily.I feel so good.I have not got a bad headache in about 3 months now.I dont have that clouded over or dopey feeling I use to get with the percs and demerol pills.The only downside to the methadone is that I sweat a little more than normal.But that is a small price to pay for being headache free and normal feeling again.I seen many er docs and regular docs and was told by a lot of them that I was drug seeking.When I got a bad headache my pulse would go up sky high and the only thing that helped was iv phenergan and dilaudid.I am so glad I dont have to go to the e.r. no more and be treated like an addict.I found a doctor who listened to me and did not judge me and he truly helped me out.Good luck to everyone!!

In the past months I've been terribly depressed and I can only assume it is the tri cyclen...I started taking it in Feb (now almost August) and I've never been so depressed in my life...I wouldn't necessarily say don't use it because I think it depends on the person and your general physical make up...but watch for signs of depression when you are on it...as for other side effects, it did take away all cramps and bloating with my period but I found my period longer and heavier on the drug instead of the other way around...I was used to light/short periods...but I'd take my cramps back anyday over this nonsense...

Works wonderfully as a birth control because I have no sex drive whatsoever.  I'm a newlywed and did not have sex until my wedding night.  You'd think being newly married, I might want to have sex with my husband every now and then.  Well, not now!  Before my sex drive was normal, now it's nonexistant.  I also don't like what it does to my period because I practically don't have one!  I'm sure this is fabulous for most women, but I actually liked my period (light bleeding never a cramp, stomach ache, or moodswing in my life).  Now I barely get a drop of blood.  Other than this, I have never experienced any problems from OTCL.  It's a perfectly good form of contraception.

Cymbalta worked immediately (first day) in lifting my depression, and with only 30mg.  My only negative side effects were nausea (passed after a few weeks and did help me lose 3-4 pounds) and loss of libido.  After 4 months it seemed to lose effectiveness, but when I increased dosage to 60mg, it worked again for 7 more months.  Then it seemed to stop working as well, so I'm being phased to Wellbutrin (which will hopefully address the libido issue).

For chronic, moderate pain this is the medication to use. It does not have the side effects of the narcotics and does not lead to the type of addiction that the others do. I take this about twice a day for chronic back and neck pain. The only side effect I ever had was feeling terribly tired. Tramadol is the generic and it is a lot less expensive.

Seems to be working pretty well. There are still days I feel a little depressed and anxious, but has helped quite a bit. I haven't been on it too long, so I know it still has more time to work even better. Side effects arent too bad. Sexual side effect is quite strong. Caused more anxiety in the beginning, but then got much better. Definitally caused insomnia in the beginning, but that is gradually getting better as well. Overall, I like it.

This is the one drug that literally saved my life from the pain of Pancreatitis.  Other drugs caused problems with my pancreas (Dilaudid and Morphine).  Had it not been for the Demerol, I am not sure what I would have done.  The medication is also very inexpensive as it is generic.  I will say, while the Generic works well, the brand does work better.

i use Diazepam to help with a sleep disorder, and have taken it for several years. I only use it when the other sleep meds prescribed don't completely work, so I call it my kicker.

I've been very happy with ortho tri-cyclen lo.  I've been on it for several years.  The side effects I've noticed are: I'm more emotionally a night or two before my period starts, have light cramps on day one, and occasional breast tenderness.  Before taking the pill I got my period less frequently, and rarely had any cramps, but over all I'm happy with this pill.

Since puberty I have struggled with feeling out of control the week before my period. By the time I was 25 my body was worn out from fighting pms and I fell into depression. The symptoms had increased to three weeks out of the month. Week before: get out of my way. Week of: Falling asleep, crying constantly. Week after: high as a kite. This left me with one normal week.  Finally at 25 my parents stepped in and demanded I see my doctor about this. It was not my imagination or my choice to feel this way. I spent close to 6 or 7 years trying different drugs to treat my PMDD. Some would work for a while and then stop. I have been on Yaz since december and it is wonderful!! So far the only side effects are that I cry a lot more lol! Trust me, I will take crying over craziness any day.

For some people Tramadol is not the right drug...for those people I understand. For me, it is wonderful. I take 100mg at night along with 50mg of Trazodone. It puts me to sleep and I sleep very well. I wake up the next day and feel great. I think it works best in combination with Trazodone, but that's me. It also helps for anxiety/OCD. It's good.

I have PCOS and BC is the only real treatment for it, but it was worse when I was on it. I would become extremely irritable, anxious, tired and suffer from continuous bleeding and headaches on any birth control I tried. So after numerous unsuccessful attempts at birth control I completely gave up hope of ever finding one that would work for me. FINALLY though I tried The Ring. I was definitely way more sensitive and emotional the first month, but have had absolutely nothing to complain about since then. My periods went from 7 - 9 days of spotting and 7 - 9 days of bleeding (3 of them heavy) to a mere light 4 days! I haven't had any problems with weight gain, acne, it falling out or feeling uncomfortable. Cramping is minimal. And as an extra bonus it has even increased my cup size (though that's typical with most BCs). I would definitely recommend this to anyone to at least try. It may not work for you, but then it again it might be a miracle as it was for me.

I have actually had great success with Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo.  I lost 25 pounds after going on it and my periods are so much better than before.  During my period I used to have terrible cramps, moodiness, extremely tender breast, and heavy bleeding, I also used to have two periods a month; but after starting the pill I am like a new and improved woman.  It took almost a year for my body to adjust to the pill, but now that it has, I'm very satisfied! I did however notice that if I don't take it at exactly the same time every morning to the second, I will encounter break through bleeding.  As long as I stay on top of it, everything is fine.

This is a great drug to use when a panic attack hits and there is no other solution.  I usually take only half a pill because talking the whole thing makes me way too drowsy.  My only complaint is that it has a tendency to upset my stomach, but other than that it is a real life saver.

I've been using the Ring for just a week now.  I don't know the long-term side effects, but for now, I haven't had many adverse effects. The very first day, I did get cramps, mild headache & weird feeling in my lower stomach, but that went away after the first day or so. Haven't tried sex yet, though I am a little nervous after hearing so many reviews speak of the pain associated.  Hopefully I will be one of the lucky ones with that as well!  So far though, it's been very convenient, I barely know it's there.  Takes a few tries to get positioning it right, but after that, it's simple!

I loved the Nuvaring has it helped me with the severe cramps I was experiencing before I started using it.  I had been extremely happy with it.  I never had any issues with it at all, that was until eight months later I started having sex. All of a sudden when I started having sex with my boyfriend not only did I experience the burning sensation afterwards but it fell out twice. Once during sex and another time I went to check it and realized it was not there.  We searched everywhere and I have no idea where it went.  I am thinking down the toilet, but when did it happen and how long was i not protected. This was very concerning as the whole point of using it is for BC.  I am thinking I am going to have to switch to a reliable alternative.

This drug has been a such a benefit in my life.  I have had generalized anxiety disorder for most of my life, sometimes more severe than others. I currently am taking .5mg along with 150mg of Effexor XR each morning and this has certainly been the best combination of anti-depressant/GAD meds my doctor has tried. I also take 1mg of xanax before I go to bed each night. After 2 weeks of treatment my blood pressure went from 190/100 to 124/78, my hot flashes ended and my pulse slowed down to a respectable 71 bpm.  I have heard horror stories about withdrawal from xanax but I will deal with that later, as for now I feel better than I have in years.  I am slowly loosing the weight I gained while self-treating my anxiety with comfort foods and I'm much more calm and less over reactive to situations that previously would have caused a major anxiety attack.  The down side of xanax is the fact it is a controlled substance and you have to keep getting a new script from your doctor.

works significantly better for me than ambien did.  i do stay aslee longer, but whats more important, when i wake up, i can fall back asleep.  im very happy with it.  the only downside though is i get a nasty taste in my mouth, which is a pretty common side effect.  the taste doesnt go away though for about 12-16 hours after you initially take the pill.  but if it helps me sleep, which it does, i can deal with it

I was imagining all kind of things as well as suffering from lower back pain and neck pain.I am on a plan now tht goes to no lithium NOW. Stop ledxapro slowing while going on Cymbalta. I am still in the process but I can tell you this if the results continue I will be the happyest person on earth. I have dealt with these issues for over 5 following a sever car accident. I feel so much better arter only 7 days. I am so excited. A chance to live while my wonderful wife who lived this can also live her life. We can live our life.

Works really quickly.  But, it left me a little out of sorts.  Of course, after taking it you should lie down.  I took it but remained active not realizing that in ten or twenty minutes I was hardly able to walk or speak.  It also caused me to suffer from double vision.  Do NOT take more than one if you are really sleepy.  This is extremely powerful drug and will do it's job.  Mainly, I suggest this product along with being careful while taking it.

I have been on YAZ for 3 months.  This is the best pill I have ever taken as far as virtually no side effects.  No breast tenderness, no weight gain, no PMS, no PMDD, no bloating, light & manageable periods with minor cramps.  There has been some light spotting, but that is to be expected in the first 1-4 months.  My skin is clear. I am very pleased with this pill.  I think all pills should be for 24 days.  You know you are on the right pill when you are not experiencing side affects which are caused by the pills hormones being either greater or less than your body's own natural hormones.  If you have a good doctor your health/period history/characteristics will give you an idea of the right pill choices for you.  They are not all the same and neither are we.

I've been on Effexor SR for several years, and have had no porblems, even at the max. dose of 225 mg. However, Effexor and Effexor XR are like two completely different medecines to me. I had a bad reaction to plain Effexor several years ago. Becaue of a sleep disorder, I take this drug when I wake up, which could be quite a few hours different each day. That doesn't effect my taking Effexor at all No problems, and I don't want to get off of it, even tho' my insurance company raised the co-pay by double.

I've been on Lutera for about 3 weeks now and the first week and a half was awful!  I had my period the entire time.  My usual cycle is about 4 days.  But, now since I finally stopped it's been going great!  Much to my surprise I started losing weight pretty quick and my breats are getting fuller.  I feel much happier actually than I did before and it helped control my mood swings.  I did feel a little sick the first week but I take it at the same time every day and it went away.  I wouldn't recommend missing any pills but this is turing out better than I thought.  Also, it totally controls my appetite and I rarely feel hungry.  I'm not sure about the periods because I have to skip the final row and only take it every 4 months to avoid my period since I have a history of cysts.  Overall I would recommend this to anyone to try.

Started on cipramil and it had some positives for a short while but am now on Effexor XR and it has been the best thing I did. Some side effects to start with, especially with major perspiration around my neck but that settled. Taking Effexor XR for depression and anxiety and I have managed to cope extremely well with some major work challenges without going into a tailspin. Occasionally get depressed but now epsiodes last a couple of hours to a coupleof days and I know that it isn't the end of the world and things will straighten out again. I am so grateful that this works for me as I can start to beand feel normal with all its highs and lows without the extreme lows. My doctor says they are forever (2 years at the moment)but he knows I am aiming to taper eventually -I am on 300mg at the moment. Initially I started on Effexor (not XR) but they were not as effective as they made me go up and down a bit each day. Cost is a factor and I am grateful that I hit the pharmaceutical limit.

Although I had to take two at a time(Dr.  said to take two if one didn't work)  I also used it after I had surgery and a bone spur was removed and it helped.

I've been on it for about two months.  The first month I was miserable. Nausea, vomiting, moodiness, sore ****, hair loss, water retention, the whole nine yards. Second month: Nausea is gone, moods are even keel, hair loss has slowed, but still have water retention and sore ****. The water retention goes away with the inactive pills, but so do the bigger **** (which really are amazing for this normally flat-chested girl--I actually have cleavage now!). No spotting ever and periods are on time. Oh, and I'm not pregnant! The **** and no baby make up for the negative side effects in my mind. So I have a little water retention--doesn't seem to phase my boyfriend :) I would recommend this pill, but caution that you can be pretty miserable the first month. I found that if I ate a little something every couple of hours, it cut down on the constant nausea (watch out for that first day, it's a doozy).

Side effects are moderately irritating -- dry mouth, problems sleeping at times, occasionally jittery, but it does exactly what it needs to for me.

Participated in original study of this drug at Sunnybrook.  After 6 mos. realized I had a placebo.  Nails of left hand and both feet were disgusting.  After taking drug for 4 mos. my nails are excellent.  Was an excellent drug for me.  Would highly recommend it!

I have been taking this pill for about 2 1/2 years. My moods were pretty normal, didnt gain any weight, didnt loose hair or anything. But the only bad thing, i was constantly spotting, and when my periods did come around i couldn't tell because i had been spotting so much. No cramps, or breast tenderness.

I was on OTCL for a year.. and i was super moody like clock work on the 3rd set of pills, and i would cry all the time.. for no freaking reasonl.. and i still had cramps.. however i recently switched to Microgisten FE 1/20 and its sucks ...i keep spotting.. and i hate it.. and ive cramped even more than ever.. my conclusion..id rather be emotional than have spotting.. this SUCKS! im going back to OTCL as soon as possible!

After suffering severe panic attacks...this drug had provided me the confidence to be normal again and know if I panic I only have 30 minutes of it to deal with.

Took 2.5 mgs for 2 weeks, nothing really.  Started 5 mgs 4 days ago,  feeling a little less anxious and panicky.  Still waiting for this to kick in.  After 2 weeks on 5 mgs will go to 10.

no more heavy long periods and cramps. The best mood and sex drive.

Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo is clearing up my acne and increasing my sex drive (allot) but making me a bit moody. Take into consideration i am a sensitive little lady already. I have only been taking it for a month so i'll comment more when i have more experience.

I've been on the ring for 4 or 5 months and immediately noticed that I no longer have ANY desire for sex whatsoever.  I've recently realized that I also have worse depression than ever and I'm guessing based on other reviews and articles about the ring that it is a side effect.  I love the convenience and plan to try supplements to increase my sex drive before stopping it completely.

I have used Imovane, as necessary, for over 15 years. I am over 60yrs of age..when looking after  my grand children for 7 mths due to an emergency situation the baby was 6mths old. I had to get up in the night as many as 2-3 times so as to get back to sleep right away after each time attending the baby I took a 1/2 pill every evening just before retiring.   When I was no longer needed to look after the children I stopped taking the med cold turkey..I did not find this pill addictive at all.  I take it occasionally today just to take the edge off so I may fall asleep right away.  Great little blue pill..I would recommend it everyone.  I have no taste in my mouth, no dryness, and no side affects the next day.  I have even taken it at 3am and get up by 8 the next morning with no difficulty..just rested.

I have tried others, and I think that this drug is really effective and side effect free.

Before birth control I had very heavy periods and such horrible cramps that also caused me to feel sick, feverish, and often times I couldn't even stand I was in so much pain, but ever since I've been on Balziva, it's been like a new life. No weight gain (thank god), no spotting, no acne (although I've never had acne), all in all it's been great!

I wrote the above review for Yaz. As mentionned, Yaz has been a God-send. I have no more PMDD symptoms while taking Yaz. But I forgot to mention (because of living an almost completely celibate life) that I have been experiencing loss of libido and anorgasmia while on it. I never had this problem before. In fact, I always had had a very healthy sex drive and was very orgasmic. It is a choice of two evils: PMDD or loss of sex drive. I will have to live with a loss of sex drive because I can't live with PMDD. I don't know what this will mean for any future relationship. No guy would want to be around me with PMDD nor would he like my lack of libido. I don't like it either..but again, I can not live with PMDD. So, I plan to take Yaz from now, at age 38, until I have menopause....stopping somewhere in the middle if I plan to have a baby.

Works well for panic attacks, but takes time to take affect.

I don't know about some of the horror stories I have read.  I have taken it for over 6 months, 2 mg a day, no need to take more, very little side effects except sleepiness.  Only other side effect is my anxiety returns when I stop using it...I really think it depends on the individual, your body chemistry, and what your exact problem is.  But it is 100 times better than anti-depressants for me and almost none of the side effects!

Ive been on it for 4 weeks now and noticed a differnce the first day. I feel like myself again. The only thing I've noticed that could be a side effect is having troubke falling asleep right away and werid dreams, not bad dreams just strange detailed dreams that i used to not have. Other than that i like it.

This product is great!!!!!!!!!!  I have used it for 2 years without any issues.  I always feel a little sick the day after I put it in, but that subsides by the following day.  I really like it because I can plan my period around my life, instead of vice-versa.

this is my first time taking birth control, i have been using lutera since september and so far the worse symptoms i have had is hot flashes in the middle of the night, I am even more horny than i was before (my boyfriend does not mind) and right before my period i seem to be more sensitive to light and i have to take out my contacts. Those are small problems. I think it is working well for me thus far. I take them to regulate my cycle and it is finally nice to know when Aunt Flow' is coming to visit

At first i noticed  a little bit of weight gain not much though like 5lbs at the most. How ever my **** did get bigger in almost one full year i went from A 32 C to a 32 DD. WHich is huge for my tiny body. Anyways, no experince of acne since i've been on the pill. However for the first couple of months i had mood swings like crazy. But overtime i got better. I never tried any other pill. But from what i read Ortho is A pretty good deal. I Always got my period on a wesnday no doubt about it. Oh one other thing make sure you have food in your stomache b-4 taking pill.. i noticed  my stomache would have sharp pains if i 4-got to eat

Got them free at PPH because of my income. I was excited after having problems keeping the patch on and feeling irritable. The first month was great. No problems with using, my BF couldn't feel it, no weight gain, and no worry for 21 days! But for the 2nd and 3rd month, I had acute mood swings and depression which wreaked havoc on my poor (and VERY patient) BF. By the 3rd month, I felt so unhappy, I didn't even want sex. Dryness and increased yeast infections (meep!) probably didn't help either. Once I saw that the hair growth and cysts the patch had helped clear up was coming back, I knew I had to switch. It just wasn't right for me personally. One thing that it did well for me was help my periods. They were lighter, like clockwork, AND I had VERY MINIMAL cramping, to the point that I started in the shower once and didn't even notice until I looked down! We all react different but if you try this and it actually works well for you, you are a lucky gal. I recommend giving it a try.

To the review below, it is not appropriate on this site for salespeople of Striant to use this forum to promote a drug that is rarely used and inconvenient.I have been on this drug for 2 years. My managed care coverage is pretty good (I pay $25/month for the pump). The only thing I would like to see improved is the volume of gel that I have to apply. The positive is that once it dries, you can't smell it, and no one knows I'm using it.My energy level has increased, I am less tired especially around 6:00 p.m. Great Drug!

I have been on Yaz for two months, not for contraceptive use but for PMDD.  Yaz has saved my life. I suffered for a good 20 years with PMDD. PMDD is hell on earth! It had totally ruined the quality of my life. My PMDD symptoms have disappeared while I have been on Yaz. Not only do I not have PMDD but I don't even have PMS while taking Yaz. Yaz has been a God-sent! I feel like a different/new person. Yaz has given me a new life. I am so suprised to not hear more similar stories about Yaz. I mainly just read accounts from women who take it only for contraception. I hope that the FDA will soon approve Yaz also for the treatment of PMDD. It truly works!!!        PS: Women who do not suffer from PMDD or PMS are extremely lucky. Many of them do not even know how lucky they are.

From the beginning I never had any spotting, or break through bleeding. My periods last 2-4 days and are so light I only need pantie liners. I have never experienced PMS on this pill, but do have occasional mood swings. I would recommend this pill to a first timer because the side effects were rarely felt for me, but always ask your physician if this is the right fit for you.

I've been taking Yaz 1.5 months.  So far, my skin has cleared up, and I don't think I've gained or lost a significant amount of weight. My cup size has increased slightly.  I do notice that my sex drive is diminished, and that sex is less intense since I started this pill.  However, this may be the case with other BC pills as well.

I didn't have any problems with it for the first month and a half, but now I've got headaches at just about every hour of every day. It has been effective as a birth control method, but the headaches are horrible. This is the first BCP I've been on, so it was a decent one to start with.

Have taken this for 8 months now. Have gained about 10 pounds. However, my sex drive is fine and my depression has lifted...I thought I'd lost hope forever, but Lexapro gave it back to me and now I see the beauty in life again. Really.

college student here reading all these negative comments. getting a little scared to start trying this product. (i guess people with negative side effects have more to rant about than people who dont.) i really hope that i wont get any side effects and that ill be the lucky other percentage who wont see any changes in their sex drives. i have a high libido, and id like to keep it that way. i get ridiculously wet, so if the pills have any effect on vaginal dryness, ill definitely know. as for the mood swings, could it be that people who complain about it being a side effect are just projecting it on the pill&#63; i mean, people have mood swings all the time. of course this has yet to be proven or nulled. yeah. definitely looking forward to see what will happen.

I've been on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo for about 8 months now. The first 1 or 2 months were sort of rough with some nausea in the morning after a few hours after I took my pill. To help with that I started taking the pill at night before I went to sleep which helped a lot. Also for the first few months I had terrible cramps! Then until about the 4th months I would have mood swings where sometimes I would be depressed, sometimes anxious, and sometimes just moody and mean. Everymonth however things got better. My cramps are back to normal, and I may or may not be depressed for 2 or 3 days. The only problem now is that for a period of about 3 days in the beginning of week two my stomach just feels weird, no nausea, but acidic, gassy, and just really uncomfortable...but I think the positives outweigh the negatives so if your having trouble just hang in there for the first few months.

Nuvaring is nice because it's super easy and you only have to worry about it twice a month.  I never got pregnant on it, but I did experience the side effects of mood swings and decreased sex drive.

Effexor XR has totally worked for me.  I was on Lexapro for GAD and it didn't quite work 100%, however, once I switched to Effexor I noticed an immediate difference.  I'm on 183mg/day and don't seem to have any side effects, including sexual.  Different antidepressants work for different people, but for anxiety disorders SNRI's seem to work better than SSRI's.

I've been on this pill for a little over a year now. During the first month I had some minor side effects, mainly nausea. My period is exactly the same as it has been my entire life: on time and lasts for just three days. My periods have been lighter and most importantly I haven't gotten pregnant! My doctor just switched me to the generic Tri-Sprintec for insurance purposes, and I'm very nervous about it. I hope it works as well as the Ortho!

This is my first ever bcp, and it has been really great for me. I am currently on my 2nd month. I started it on the first day of my period and the only side effect I had was that period lasted a long time(but was very light).  No negative side effects! When my period started, it came on time it was less painful than it used to be and was normal. These comments would have scared me if I would have read them before I took it, but this pill has been great for me!

Since I went on Lutera, my cramps have been better, I know exaclty when I'm going to get my period, and my flow is a lot lighter.  I haven't experienced any side effects and it's relatively cheap.

Works fast, few side effects if any, very cheap.  Can be addictive but it can be a lifesaver.  Stops panic attacks, but can make you sleepy.
