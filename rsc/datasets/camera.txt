We bought this camera and have been more than happy with it's performance.  We are not professional photographers, we just needed something easy, cheap, and reliable.  This camera is all those things!  The battery issue we heard about does not seem to be a problem, the pictures come out crisp, and it could not be easier to learn how to use.  We are very pleased with this product.

I have owned several high end digital SLR cameras including the Canon XT and XTi.  I have also owned several point and shoot cameras including the Canon G7 and the Panasonic TZ3.  This camera is a blend that combines the performance of the DSLRs and the ease of use of the point and shoot.The camera features the ultrasonic focusing motor of the Canon DSLR lens which makes it focus faster than most point and shoot cameras.  Along with that speed comes a focusing accuracy similar to a DSLR.  The 12x zoom range has an amazing reach, equivalent to 36mm to 432mm (in a 35mm film camera).The controls on the camera are well laid out.  It is evident that Canon has learned from all previous models and they finally have things about right.  With the additional adapters it is possible to add ND filters or a tele-converter to give a top end of 950mm or more (Raynox 2020).For me the DSLR equipment load was just too much.  If your camera and lens cost so much you can't take them on vacation, they are worthless no matter how good the pictures might be.  With the S5 IS you get great pictures AND a camera you can afford to replace if it gets stolen or damaged.

I'm considering returning this camera.Functions are not so bad considering the price. But, battery life is really short. It's maybe because this camera does not work on the voltage which is a little lower than full.I could use the battery battered from this camera for the other camera.

This camera is amazing! The 7.1 megapixels make extremely clear pictures and the size is great for a point-and-shoot camera.  It is working out great for business and personal!

Reading through the reviews, I'm glad to see that I'm not the only person having trouble with the autofocus.  It's pretty good with distant wide-angle focusing, and the super-macro setting works well if you're 0.5cm away from the subject... but I have a lot of trouble focusing while zooming in. (Notes: the zoom can only operate with normal and macro settings; super-macro is wide-angle only. And if you're unfamiliar with the term "macro," that's what you use for close-up shots.)Apparently, if you want your subject to take up the entire frame, either you need to physically put your lens a couple millimeters away from the subject OR you can zoom in from across the room.  There is no middle ground.I had a few focusing troubles with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001AU6H6">Nikon Coolpix 3200 3.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom</a>, too, and I was excited that the Fuji had a manual focus.  My excitement was misplaced.  The manual focus is intended to deliberately make things BLURRY.Another annoying feature is the dial explanations.  Every time you twiddle the dial, a brief explanation of the dial setting appears on the screen for a couple seconds.  I'm sure this is fine and helpful when you're just starting out, but I've had this camera for a week, and I KNOW what the dial settings are now and don't need to waste the 2 seconds.  I can't find any way to turn this feature off.By default, the when you take a picture, it appears on the screen for 1.5 seconds.  If you don't have 1.5 seconds to spare, there is the option of NOT displaying the photo you just took on the LCD screen.  It doesn't totally eliminate shutter lag, but it helps a little.You need the memory card.  The internal memory of the camera only holds about 15-20 pictures (at 7MP).Now, despite all I've said, this camera isn't a COMPLETE waste of money.  The resolution is good, and I do like the 10x optical zoom when I need it, but I can't help feeling that these features could be found on other cameras.  I like the manual settings that allow you to control individual aspects of the picture (aperture, shutter speed, ISO speed, etc.), but again, I'm not sure any of these are unique to this camera.What is unique is the lack of moving parts.  The 10x optical zoom is all internal.This isn't a bad camera.  I just wish it had a manual focus ring for times when the autofocus decides to give me a hard time.

The Canon PowerShot A560 is a great camera for beginners. It is easy to use and it is very good quality. The graphics are great and it takes the picture quickly. It has a wonderful face identification feature which makes the picture even better than it was before. After you take the picture you can also do a red eye correction, i mean, who wants red  eyes?! I love this camera!

This is my second Sony cybershot digital camera, although I have purchased Kodak Easy Shares for family members.  I loved the first one (only 3.2 MGP).  This camera is perfect for the not-so-tech-wise consumer.  It takes great pictures and has a high quality Zeiss lens.  Most of all it is easy to use, especialy for the beginner and intermediate user.  It stores easlily in a pocket and I love the color choices Sony gives you!  The review pictures button is a little small, but you get used to it quickly.

This camera was purchased for a eleven year old as a middle school graduation gift.  She adores it.  The camera has held up to constant use, battery life is good.  The camera is simple and easy to use.  We also purchased a Kingston 2GB SD card so that the movie function on the camera could be used.  Also purchased a flash reader so that the photos could be uploaded to the computer without connecting the camera directly (saves on batteries).  This camera was such an excellent price for the quality and ease of use that we just purchased the same camera again with the Kingston 2GB card and flash reader.  This time, it was a birthday gift for a twelve year old.  We have no complaints - the product is a good product for the price.  P.S.  If you purchase the SD card and reader at Best Buy, you will pay nearly double the cost that you will pay through Digital Media Source.

I bought this one for my dad. He wanted a camera that has the flexibility and power of SLR but still very easy to use like point and shoot. This one was a perfect fit with very affordable price from amazon. Only drawback with this camera is the lens cover as it easily comes off.

I've not been a fan of Olympus' most recent compact digital cameras, but the Stylus 710 is winning me over.  First, it's just a gorgeous camera.  It's unusual shape makes it appear very small once it's in your hands.  Its metal finish looks smart yet rugged.  Controls on such a small camera are always less than ideal, but they're done well here.The menu is very good, especially in the photo example/text description it gives you in the scene modes.  Don't have your manual?  Just turn the selection dial to the "guide" mode, and it'll get you there!The weather proof ability sets this apart from most of the competition.  You may not plan on using your camera in the rain, but the rain may not plan on your taking pictures!As I've stated before, I'm not a big fan of the xD cards.  SD is simply dominate right now, easier to find, more capatible with more things, and usually easier to find a bargin.  But the new "H" series cards are of equal quality to the best SD cards.  But xD card and charger with a 3' cord (v. flipout plug), drops this winner one star.

This is a fantastic little camera - especially for point and shoot users who just want a camera to take snapshots and is not interested in becoming a rocket scientist in order to learn how to operate the camera.  A 7.2 MP and fast shutter with reasonable flash for its size, its hard to mess up pictures.

So far I am very pleased with this camera. The picture quality is excellent, small enough for purse or pocket, & easy to use. Battery life appears to be longer than I expected so that is a plus. Can highly recommend this point and shoot Digital Elph.

This is the best camera I've ever owned. It looks amazing, has an amazing screen, takes great pictures and videos with sound, and has a simple settings menu that works great for almost every kind of picture imaginable. The battery lasts forever, is easy and quick to charge, and works like a charm. I used mine nonstop for an entire week at a beach vacation and the battery didn't die until two weeks AFTER the vacation. Memory cards are easy to come by and work great.The absolute only thing wrong with this camera is that the screen is very large and thus very easily scratched.I use the camera to take photos for my home business, to videotape my friends, to take photos of me and my friends, and to take photos on trips. It all works great.LOVE THIS. I recommend it to EVERYONE.

We have had this camera for about a year.  We wanted an inexpensive camera but buying this was a big mistake.  The picture quality is terrible and now it is not even working. We have a Canon Powershot A60 as well and have been very happy with the performance.  I would not recommend this Polaroid camera to anyone.

My husband and I have had two of these cameras. They both lasted about a year. The first one quit working when we took it to the beach. It was 50 feet away from the water, and we covered it in a towel to keep it dry and sand-free, but it quit working that day. We got a replacement because it was still under warranty. The second one lasted a little over a year, and it quit working when we took it to a swimming hole with us. Again, we made sure it was wrapped up and inside a backpack. A friend took it out for one picture, and after that it stopped working. There was water involved both times, and I think that might have something to do with it, but neither time did the camera get anywhere near the water, and it wasn't humid, either. All in all, it's a cheap camera, and it's great if you never take it outside, but I wouldn't reccomend this camera.

I ordered this camera as a replacement for our venerable Sony P90 which has been having some battery issues lately. Choice was between this or the Sony T100. In the end went with Canon on price and form factor.The Good- Video quality is excellent (as long as you don't use the zoom). I find myself using this more than my video camera now mainly because of the great portability- Amazing battery life - Pictures look great, still use the SLR for super high quality pics but this will do 99% of what most casual users need.- Loads of picture 'modes' with presets, not much fine grain control but didn't really expected in this form factor- It's tiny, very portable with quick startup meaning you find yourself taking a lot more shots.- Face recognition is a nice feature, finding a lot less reject images The Bad- Supplied SD Card is too small (as usual) - No low battery indicator. Warning is given only when the battery is almost out which is unfortunate since the battery lasts for ages and will undoubtedly mean a flat battery when you least expect it.

I purchased this camera to replace a DSC-W50 which broke.  I assumed I was too rough on that camera and thought I would try a new one and be more careful with it.  I kept this camera in a case the whole time I had it. I used it for less than 30 pictures and after 34 days I pulled it out of the case and found the LCD cracked.  I sent it to Sony and they are going to charge me $111 to fix it.  I would not buy another Sony camera again.

This camera offers an excellent value for the price that you pay. It takes excellent pictures set on the automatic mode but yet offers the opportunity to set the shutter speed, aperture, etc. if you are so inclined.  It also offers a large screen which makes it great to review the pictures. The only complaint I have is that the batteries do not last long and you always have to carry an extra set with you.-  You do not get much warning that they are low. I suggest that you purchase a set of 4 re-chargable AA batteries and rotate. However, the fact that it uses AA batteries and does not have a built in battery is an assect and one of the reasons I like this line of Canon cameras. At least you can easily purchase and replace them and keep shooting!

We absolutely love this camera.  This was an upgrade from our S400 which died on us after about 4 years.  The large screen on the back is HUGE and allows you to see enough detail on your picture to know whether or not you got the shot you wanted.  Additionally, the controls are intuitive and displayed very clearly on the screen.  We've had a few grainy pictures but nothing that 7.1 mega-pixels couldn't fix.  By the time we shrunk the pictures down to print size the graininess disappeared.  Overall a great buy.

I just got my Sony s650 camera and I love it!  At first I was skeptical on if I made the right purchase or not because I read so many reviews saying the cost of the memory card was just too expensive, but when I went to purchase the memory card (I trust Sony which is why I decided to just go with the Sony camera) the salesman told me you do NOT have to buy a Sony Pro Duo memory card, you can buy any brand just as long as it is a Pro Duo card. I highly recommend this camera for anyone who wants to take great (non-professional) pictures.  Indoor and outdoor photos are fantastic and I'm really pleased I decided to go with this camera.Don't just trust reviews you've read, everyone has different opinions and tastes... try the camera out before you buy it and then make your decision.

I purchased the camera based on the reviews of the camera and I wanted a camera with a zoom greater than 4x optical zoom.  The 10x optical zoom has been great.  I don't like the lense cap as it's constantly popping off and the on/off switch is right next to the zoom.  Often times I meant to zoom and instead turned off the camera.  I do like that it just takes regular double A batteries and I was able to use the memory card from my previous digital camera.  Overall for the price, it's been a good camera.

Fantastic value.Sweet little camera!  Seems to take pictures "quickly" -- as if they've eliminated a lot of that delay in between clicking the button and taking the picture.  The video feature includes audio and actually takes pretty good little movies.We couldn't be more pleased with this little camera for what we paid for it.

I bought this camera to replace a Canon A70 that I bought about 4 years ago. The A70 LCD screen stopped working. I set out to buy to buy something thin and small to drop in a breast shirt pocket. This is not going to fit in the breast pocket of a shirt- at least not comfortably. But it does have camera feel and look and I walk around with it in my pants pocket fine. It takes very good pictures and has many options like image stabilization and manual controls. As mentioned it has the look and feel of a traditional camera albeit smaller and is comfortable for shooting. This uses two AA batteries (A70 used 4). AA batteries means you can always get power in a pinch. Get rechargeable NiMH batteries to save a bunch of $$ and you will use this to snap pictures all the time. The A570is is an improved version of the A70 which I had good results with so I went with something I knew. Also the reviews elsewhere are almost universally good. I think this camera compares favorably in every respect to most anything out there with the exception of size. But the really small cameras sacrifice some of the features or if not, are quite a bit more expensive.

I LOVE the way this camera looks.  Sleek compact, and the shiny blue is awesome.  I wanted to love this camera so much, and chose it over a camera that got better reviews because I am a girl and sometimes put style ahead of product.  Big mistake.  I was pretty disappointed that this camera did not have a good "shutter speed"; many of my first pictures came out very blurry.  We soon learned we had to hold the camera very steady in order to get clear pictures.  I am also disappointed in the clarity on closeup shots.  A big reason for this purchase was so I could sell some jewelry and other items I have on EBay, however I've found I can't get clear closeups, and you can't adjust the zoom for closeup shots.  Other than these items, it's a great camera, with clear, vibrant pictures.

OK, maybe I don't want to take it where it's excessively wet; I hear the digital cameras don't like water, but the A560 has been flawless, lightweight, and a great camera to always have with you. I'm still a film fan, and shoot pro film in serious SLRs, but some excellent shots have come from the A560 (a last minute trip over to the coast yielded some perfect shots of starfish I would not have otherwise captured!).With a 2GB chip, I don't think I'm likely to run out of storage on a hike (closing in on 6000 pictures possible on the lower res settings). I did find it depleting the regular alkaline batteries pretty fast, so I got rechargeable NiCads and have very pleased with those.The price is great, and I've used Canon cameras for years. This is simply a very fine choice for a small, yet quality, digital P&S.

Being a Wildland Forest Fire Fighter you get to see and do things that most don't get to experience in a life time. I got this camera right before I was sent off to the Castle Rock fire in Warm Springs/Ketchum, Idaho..that you may have seen/heard on the news. I was thrilled to see the picture quality and versatillity with the different shooting modes. My pictures turned out great. Though, my memory card didn't hold as many pictures as I would have liked....around 20-22 with 16MB disk. Overall, this camera fits my needs.

This camera is excellent. We are still learning how to use it, but already the pictures we got are fantastic. We tried and reviewed a lot of cameras before buying this one: Kodaks, Canons, etc. We decided for this one because of the picture quality, the optical zoom,  and the movies. The movies are great! The sound is perfect, and you don't have that noise because of the auto adjusting of the lenses. When you put it into a computer the quality of the video and sound are great. If you are going to get a memory card for this camera, I suggest you follow the ones that appear in the manual, that is, buy the SanDisk Extreme III or SanDisk Ultra II. We bought a Kingstom instead, because it was cheaper, but the quality of the videos and the pictures are very bad compared to using the internal memory of the camera or those SanDisk cards. One thing I noticed is that the pictures look like grainy in the LCD of the camera sometimes, but after you pass them to your PC, they look really great!The servive was very good. We bought it with Butterfly.com, and it arrived sooner than we expected. And the price also is fantastic here at Amazon. You wont get it cheaper!

Great zoom, professional shots, lots of settings (night, portrait, etc etc etc) will have to take some time to figure it all out. only thing i think coud be improved is the fact that your finger can rest over the pop up flash sometimes blocking it.

I bought this camera because Ive been holding out on buying an expensive top of the line point and shoot for casual picture taking. Im going on vacation soon, so I decided to spend a little to get a little. This camera delivers exactly that. The picture quality is good for emailing pictures to friends and relatives, and the size and style of the camera are great. The battery life and lcd screen are some things that arent that great. A room that you might think is not that dark will show only black on the LCD screen. The flash at close ranges will wash out colors at times. All these things that are considered to be flaws with a camera have turned out to be the reason I really love the pictures this camera takes. Many pictures look somewhat artsy and while others may think the colors are off or the picture is blurry, I think the pictures this little inexpensive camera takes are interesting. After buying this camera and a 512mb memory stick for less than $100, I may never get around to buying that expensive 7 megapixel camera.

I bought this Sony DSCW55 digital camera about a month ago and overall it's a pretty good camera but I have a few complaints. First, even with the camera set to the Macro setting on the camera's mode dial my pictures weren't all that clear and it wasn't because my hand was shaking or anything. Some pictures just came out blurry. Also, the shutter button needs to be pressed down hard to get passed the automatic focus (even then it sometimes gets hung up on auto focus). If you want to take, for example,  a quick picture my camera will often go into auto focus and by then the object I want to catch will be gone. I like to snap and then have the camera shoot the picture. Shutter speed is also slow with this camera. Shooting movies is simple, just set the mode dial and you're all set. The quality of the videos is okay but not great. Don't expect perfect camcorder movies on this camera. With an optional memory stick you can easily download lots of picture or movies with Sony's Picture Motion Browser software cd (supplied with the camera) which downloads into your computer. By the way the camera is very small and I would suggest tying the supplied strap to it. Put the strap around your wrist while taking pictures or movies and you won't accidentally drop it.

This is the first camera that I bought for my mom. It is easy to use and has all the basic features. It would be better if had had the panoramic image feature - but this camera has good value for money. The image quality is good  -almost as good as another 12x zoom 8MP camera that I have. Easy to learn to use and it comes with 16MB of external memory. we almost lost the 16MB card that was hidden inside the box.

If I lost it, I'd buy another.

This is a great camera for snap shot photos. Pictures are sharp! I have a canon 20d and love it. However it is heavy to carry around with all the lens. The sd1000 is amazing for the tiny size. The best part is that it is fun. I love it and highly recommend. You can't go wrong with a cannon.

After one month, hours of video and probably 100+ pictures, I'm happy to report I'M STILL ON THE ORIGINAL BATTERIES! :)  My last Olympus was absolutely awful with batteries and Olympus kept wanting to charge me to fix a known issue so I gave up on it.  The last 3 vacations with it I would be 4-5 pictures in and I would get the low battery beep so I'm extremely pleased that as others have said, this one has great battery life.  Videos are great, stills are good (I'm not the best so fuzzy pictures are partly my fault I'm sure), I'm a little disappointed in night pictures, it seems to have trouble focusing on what I want, or maintining the focus while handheld.  But for the $ and features, I'm happy and would recommend this if you're looking for a good zoom camera.

I spent weeks researching which digital camera to buy.  I checked out all of the latest ones with new features and higher MP or Optical but I always came back to this one.  It has been rated the best and most popular so I figured since so many people love it why not join the club.  I'm glad I did.  I love this camera!  It's my first digital because I couldn't stand missing another picture opportunity because I ran out of film or having undeveloped pictures in my camera for months waiting to finish the roll.This camera fits all of my needs and allows me to print photos immediately with the help of my Canon MP530 which is also a great buy.  My photos come out like I took them to Walmart or Target to get printed on Kodak paper.  I'm using rechargeable batteries and bought my own 2G SD card.  I'm completely happy and love all the features so if your looking for a great point & shoot digital camera this is the one to buy.

This is my 3rd Canon Elph (I like to drop and spill:). I love the camera and my only complaint in the past has been shooting in dark bars/restaurants. Subjects tend to get washed out and the background is very dark. Not any more! In this new version, not only is the background not dark and equal in lighting to the subject, the camera picks up the colors in the background so well. Everyone who views my pictures on the LCD ends up asking what kind of camera it is. Great pictures.

Pictures were printed fuzzy on every setting I tried.  They looked pretty good on the monitor but when I got my prints back from kodak gallery I wasn't a happy camper.I thought since it was a 7.2 MP that it would be better than my Canon 3.2 but I was wrong.  Also the rinky dink memory card is a PIA.  You might want to think twice when it comes to a Sony cybershot.  I am going to buy a Canon again.

The camera works very well.  We bought it for use as just a camera, although the video is easy to use and upload if you need it in a pinch.  Pictures are very good, and surprisingly bright.  Close up pictures (2-3 feet) still come up a bit blurry, but for normal use this should not be a problem.  Definitely easy to use, and I would recommend for anyone looking for a point and shoot camera to just get some pictures.

After doing tons of comparisons and research, we purchased this camera. We use it daily taking pictures of our child and our travels, it is used indoors and out, the 12X optical zoom is great and the video feature is excellent and produces short high quality videos.I would highly recommend buying a large memory card and the optional lens adapter, it makes the camera easier to hold and you can protect the lens with a 58mm skylight filter. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009O6IXA">Canon LAH-DC20 Conversion Lens Adapter (LA-DC58E) and Hood (LH-DC40) Set for the S5 IS, S3 IS & S2 IS Digital Camera</a>This camera has surpassed our expectations, the menus are simple and the performance is awesome. If you are looking for a great all around camera just short of a DSLR, look no further this is it.

In a sentence, this is a great camera and I am thrilled with it.  Most everything has been covered in the other reviews, so I will stick to some items that stood out for me.  The Good:All of the automation makes it a great point and shoot camera for "standard" pictures.  Set it to auto mode and have at it.  The results are great.  What is nice, is all the optional settings available for "special" situations when you are so inclined.I use the view finder most of the time and it is nice and bright. I wasn't that excited about the vari-angle display before getting the camera, but now I am happy to have it.  I like the idea that I can keep it "closed" to protect the screen from scratches and dirt during most of my shooting when using the view finder, yet use it for reviewing pictures and making menu changes.  I also like the large size and the quality of the display.  The biggest surprise was the quality of the sound when using the movie mode.  It takes a nice quality video and is so simple to use.  Just push the dedicated button to start, then again to stop. (I have not found a way to "pause" the video, so each cycle created a new file.)  A big plus for the Canon is the ability to zoom while capturing the video.  This was the main selling point for me when trying do decide between the Canon and Panasonic.  Finally, the camera has a good overall feel.  The button layout makes sense for the most part, and considering the complexity, it is fairly intuitive.  Not so Good:This is one of the worst manuals for any product I have ever owned.  It is poor physically and poor in content.  The print is small and the icon images blur into the cheap paper.  The manual will instruct you to push a button by showing the button icon rather than naming the button.  Because of the poor print quality, it is hard to make out the image of the button.  Additionally, the starter guide booklet defines many of the button icons, but Cannon decided to save on a couple of sheets of paper and did not include this information in the main manual.  As for content, it is lacking.  The instructions basically show a setting, but there is little or no explanation as to what is happening or the cost associated with a particular option. Much of the manual consists of poorly laid out charts that are hard to understand.  Basically, the manual does not define terms and do not introduce concepts.  Anyone new to photography will have to find other sources that explain what is being discussed in the manual.  The saving grace is that the actual camera is well designed and relatively intuitive.  Use the manual as a starting guide, then experiment with the settings.  Film is cheap with a digital!  The software CD does not include a PDF file of the manual, but you can down load it from the Canon web site.  The only problem I have had so far is that the date/time function has reset itself to zeroes on three occasions.  It appears to happen after I remove the SD card to transfer the files to my computer via a card reader.  What is strange is it does not happen all of the time.  I am trying to figure out the pattern.  Other Comments:You can remove the trim ring off the front of the lens and add an adaptor tube for a teleconverter, wide angle, or filter lens.  Canon only shows 58mm accessories, but 52mm also works.  I went with the after market Lensmate Online adaptor in 52mm to keep the size down.  (If I weren't interested in small size and low weight, I would have bought a DSLR.)I sent Canon Support an e-mail question before buying.  They responded within a few hours.  They actually read my note in detail, then directly answered the question.  Amazing!  I called Panasonic with a simple product question, but they could not answer it.  They took my phone number with a promise to call back soon.  I am still waiting ........Many have complained about the battery cover and using this cover for the SD card storage.  I agree it is a dumb design, but I didn't find it to be a significant problem.  What to buy???? Keep in mind that other manufacturers are coming out with 18X zoom factor cameras.  Olympus has the SP-550 (poor reviews) and announced the SP-560. Panasonic announced the FZ18.  I suspect Canon will have to respond.  It will be interesting to see if they replace the S5 in the near future or add an 18X zoom model in addition to the S5.  After some thought I decided the S5 12X met my needs and decided not to wait.  (I also considered a potential downside of a larger size lens, more weight, and lens design compromises.) As pointed out in many of the professional reviews, the downside of a super zoom point and shoot like the S5, compared to a DSLR, is more "noise" in low light situations, slower lens (f stop setting), and lack of optional lens.  However for most of us taking pictures of vacations, birthdays, camping trips, etc, these are non issues.  The S5 will meet most all of our requirements without the size, weight and cost of a DSLR. Don't get lost in the details of the reviews.   In conclusion, I really like this camera!

I recently bought the Olympus Stylus 750 w/o comparison shopping when I found myself on vacation without the charger for my usual camera.  On the whole, this has proved to be a pretty good pocket camera.  The 5x magnification is a big plus, and there is no size or weight penalty for the added magnification.  The camera fits both the hand and the pocket very well.  The Olympus also offers two levels of macro mode for closeups, and I got some rather good pictures using these (e.g. a full-screen picture of a dragonfly perched on a bush).  And in all fairness, I got a lot of satisfactory pictures using the Olympus.However, I did not end my trip loving the camera.  The biggest problem is that the LCD screen is essentially unreadable outdoors in daylight, so framing pictures under these conditions is mostly guess work.  Since more than half of my pictures on the recent trip were made under outdoor, daylight conditions, I found the LCD problem intensely frustrating.  This is my third camera with image stabilization, the other two are Panasonic Lumix models.  By comparison, I got a larger number of blurry pictures using the the Olympus than I usually do using the Lumix cameras.  It may be, however, that reading the advanced manual (which comes on CD, only a basic manual comes in print with the camera) will show me how to use the Olympus image stabilization to better effect.The number and size of the buttons is also inconvenient, as many reviewers (including those on non-Amazon sites) have pointed out.  And it is essential to carry a second, charged battery with you, since the battery life is at best average, and the system for warning of low charge is not very effective.  Overall, I rate the Oympus 750 as a good, serviceable pocket camera with some significant plusses but also with significant minuses.  I believe that one can probably do better at the price.

This camera can be described in two words, "Simply Awesome!!"  For the money it's worth its weight in gold.  It is very user friendly.  If you've ever had a fuji camera in the past, you only have to read the manual in a limited fashion to use ALL of the functions.  It takes wonderful, crisp, colorful pictures...in every setting imaginable.  Also, it has a video recording function with sound to boot. If you're looking for a good camera, you'll really get the most bang for your buck with this one!

Overall, I have been extremely happy with this camera. I have had it for a little under a month now. It has several distinct advantages over my old Olympus.A few reasons I love this camera (not an inclusive list):1. This camera has a fixed lens, where my Olympus extended the lens when it powered up (and complained bitterly if you forgot to take the lens cap off). Yes, it's a small thing, but it makes a difference.2. The lens cap has a cord that attaches it to the camera so you don't lose it. Yes, it's another small thing, but I can't tell you how many times I've lost the one for my previous camera.3. The 10x optical zoom is EXCELLENT and I'm having a lot of fun with that.4. It uses normal AA batteries - which means, if your batteries run out in the middle of the day, you can get replacements almost anywhere.My complaints:1. The autofocus for close-up shots is a little quirky. Maybe it's just that I haven't gotten used to it. It does fine if you're within an inch of the object, or several feet away and zooming all the way in. In between, it's a little quirky. 2. The menu explanations can get annoying. They appear for a couple of seconds after changing a setting. After using the camera for a day, you don't really need them, but there doesn't seem to be a way to turn them off.3. There are so many little buttons all over it, I keep accidentally activating them as I take it out of my camera case.4. There are no instructions (that I can find) on how to format the card with the camera.This is not a compact pocket camera. I don't list that as a complaint because I wasn't looking for a pocket camera.I had little trouble getting the free 1GB card offered by Amazon, although it wasn't intuitive that you had to first add the card to your cart, then put in a promotional code to take the price of it off the total. It is an SD card, and I have had no trouble transferring photos between the camera and computer. It stores over 1100 photos.Lastly, I would recommend a card reader for anyone who doesn't have one. Forget about cables, and directly connecting the camera to the computer, and running down your camera batteries while downloading. Better yet, get an internal multi-card reader; you can cut down on peripheral clutter and probably use it for years to come.

This camera is not weather proof as claimed and Olympus will find any reason to void the warranty.  I purchased this camera about five months ago, and was very pleased with it those first five months.  The high resolution and many shooting modes worked well.  I purchased this camera over the many, many other cameras with similar resolutions because of Olympus' claim that it is "weather proof."  However, the first time I used it in the rain, the camera failed completely.  When I opened up the battery compartment, there was water inside. Olympus refused to cover the repair under warranty because my camera was not in brand new condition because it has some normal nicks and scuffs (the kind that happen to anything that you keep in your pocket all the time).  So, I have to pay Olympus $193.00 to fix their defective camera.  BE WARNED -- Olympus will void the warranty unless your camera is in out-of-the box new condition, so the warranty is not worth the paper it is printed on.  Olympus has the worst customer service of any large company I have ever dealt with and the sole purpose of their customer service department seemed to be to deny warranty claims.  I recommend against purchasing any Olympus product.

Very easy to use right out of the box.  This is my second digital from Fuiji so the opertation of  the camera and menu were very similar.  I liked that alot.  Nice clear pictures.  Highly recommend to anyone for a camera a little more technical than a plain point and shoot.

This camera is top notch!I had one of the original Cybershots so I decided on getting a newer version.The pictures are amazing at 7 MP, simply amazing. Be warned though if you want to take pictures at this quality you should really get a memory stick as the internal memory will only hold 6 pictures. You can go through the settings and bring the quality down to hold more. I think you can get well over 100 pictures on VGA mode (about a normal camera phone quality)The actuall use of the camera is very easy, just like any of the Cybershots. There are a lot of different modes for different lighting situations along with landscapes, portraits ect. I have not messed with those yet but it seems to be some good add on's.The size of this camera is fantastic, fits in the palm of your hand, light as a feather.The display is beautiful also. All in all I am extremely happy with this purchase, highly reccomended.

Si lo que estas buscando es una cámara que sea de uso cotidiano para cumpleaños, bautizos y fiestas de familia o con amigos, esta es la camara que buscabas, tiene buena resolución y el zoom me parece fabuloso. La vida de la bateria es muy corta pero compre un cargador SONY con 4 baterias AA de 2400mAh y la combinación es excelente, no soy adicto a la captura de imagenes y no es necesario llevar las de repuesto, aunque debido a la tremenda pantalla LCD de 2.5 pulgadas, es una tentación el ver las fotos desde la camara pues se pueden apreciar con gran calidad.Es super liviana y sumamente practica de usar, puedes usar una memoria SD de hasta 4 Gb y con una de 1Gb es mas que suficiente. Si les preocupa la duración de la bateria, pues prueben que otra camara con la misma pantalla y un flash similar para que se den cuenta que es comun en este tipo de camaras.

I was so excited to get the camera and very let down after the first week of usage.  I had to carry double A batteries every where I went.  I was constantly replacing them.  I missed some very important shots because of low batteries causing a delay in the shutter speed.  The zoom is extremely week and creates grainy pictures.  A digital zoom is needed.  I am returning this product and puchasing the sd870IS by canon.

The Sony W55 is the followup to the successful and popular W50. It's a very good compact camera, easy to carry and easy to use, and reasonably priced - so most people will be happy with it.  Not much has changed from the W50, which in this case is a good thing!One change is that the W55 is a 7 MP camera, rather than the W50's 6MP. Honestly, that's not a big plus, as they haven't made the sensor that catches the light any larger.  Same (good) lenses, same size sensor = the same (good) pictures, but not better.  (Though it might help a little on features like Smart Zoom.)The obvious change is of course the colors.  Don't make too much fun of that!  There are 4 DSC-W series cameras in our family, colors would have kept my mother-in-law from taking my sister's camera home with her.  A little personalization is a good thing.The internal memory has been expanded (to 56MB), but I've never used the internal memory on the cameras that have had it, so I'm not sure that matters much.  It might be worth knowing how to use as a backup, for another dozen or two shots if your card is full, or you have some other problem.The controls, menus and interface on the W55 are reasonably easy to use.  For example, the W55 has easy access to the various scene modes (twilight, etc), with some explanation on the screen of what those mysterious little icons mean (so you might actually use them, since it tells you what they do!). If you're new to digital photography, there will be a learning curve.  But if you've used other cameras much, especially Sonys, you can pick this up and use many of the features right away.Read the short introductory guide that comes with the camera, though!The rechargeable battery should easily last you for a full day of shooting - hundreds of shots - with no problem. (Be a little wise about turning it off when you're not using it!) So you probably don't need a second battery, unless you're going into the woods for a while.  It's nice not to have to mess with bulky AA rechargeables. Also, lithium ion batteries don't have a memory effect, so don't worry about partial recharging. Just charge the battery each night. So - before getting a second battery, try it for a while and see if you need it. But get a case - something to protect the screen, at least.  A fully closed one might help resist rain and splashes a little, too.You'll also want to get a Memory Stick Pro Duo card - Pro cards are faster, and you need the smaller Duo size with this camera. Get a 1-2GB card so you don't have to think about running out of memory too much - if you shop carefully, you can find them for so little these days that it's well worth avoiding running out of memory.  You might want a spare card if you plan to travel for more than a week, or use the video mode often - which is surprisingly good (though a bit dark) if set to fine, but uses enormous amounts of storage at that setting.You can stretch your memory, and your hard drive space, by using one of the lower-resolution settings to take snapshots.  You don't really need 7MP for all your photos!The W55 will take better photos than those credit-card type cameras that have a tiny lens system - optics will always make a difference in a camera.  Any reasonable person will be very happy with the pictures from the W55, given the size of it. The camera will be a little slow and often take disappointing pictures in low light and dark situations.  Try the High ISO mode in low light no-flash situations - the picture quality suffers some, but most people will find it useful. Realistically, no ultra-compact camera will work really well in that situation - if you need that often, think about something with a bigger lens and bigger sensor. Good light always gives the best pictures with any camera. There are limits to what you can currently expect from any ultracompact camera. The W55 offers enough controls (through the scene modes and the Program mode) to allow a fair amount of control over the pictures, for an automatic camera. The charger is fairly compact and rated 100-240V, so while you'll need a plug adapter overseas you won't need a voltage converter. The battery charger is a little slow, though probably OK.Keep this camera charged and handy, and you'll find you take a lot of pictures because it's easy to carry and easy to use!

I bought this camera partially based on the reviews I read.  While it takes good pictures and is easy to use, the software isn't worth a hoot!  I am still unable to transfer photos from the camerausing Olympus Master software to my computer....the message comes up that there is no camera connected.  However, i can transfer the photos using Windows with the same connection.  I've read and reread the manual, connected and disconneted the camera a number of times and it still doesn't work.  My other complaint is that the battery runs out really fast.  It always needs recharging even though i don't use it that much.  If it weren't so cumbersome to package it all back up, i'd send it back and get a refund.

This camera has earned a place at my side at all times!  The pictures are fantastic (Canon's always been at the top) and the features are easy to use.  The color swap and accent features are A BLAST to play with and actually work quite well.  The video is a little dark in low light conditions, but quite good for what it is...(it actually records video at 30fps which is slightly better than your eyes processing rate, so that's way cool).  Great quality for a low price!  BUY THIS!!!!!!

We had an early Nikon Coolpix camera and were looking for a new camera.  Specifically, we wanted a camera that was small enough to take around with us, took quick photos and had good quality.  The SD 1000 delivered on all of those and more.  Unlike our friends with SLRs, we can take our SD 1000 literally anywhere without feeling like it's too big to carry around or good out for a good photo shot.  The thing just fits right in your pocket and is very durable.  The thing we love about it is how quickly you can get a point and shoot.  From reaching into your pocket until taking a photo is just a few seconds.  And shot to shot time is very fast (we turn off the auto preview after each shot).  The photo quality is all you can ask for for a camera in this range.  Like most, it has a little trouble in dark conditions and the Flash produces red-eye most of the time.  Make sure you get an extra battery (we got 2 on eBay for $10) and a large, fast memory card (ours is 2GD at 120X and stores about 1000 images).  Overall, I can think there's a better value on the market than the SD 1000.  If you want a camera you can take anywhere that is fast and takes good pics, this is the one for you.  Canon gets it right again.

I bought this for my mom, who's not particularly tech-savvy, and it was relatively easy for her to figure out and use.  Besides that though, it's a great little camera.  I have the SD600, and I noticed that this upgrade has a bigger and clearer screen, more options, and is a little thinner to boot.  Highly recommended.

80% of the time the pictures from this camera are blurry - even with the 2 types of stabilization.  I am an avid picture taker (approx 400 per month) - and my previous Kodak camera was 100 times better than this camera.  The controls are hard to use on this Stylus.  Taking pictures of Holiday lights downtown on Chicago's Magnificent Mile, you might as well forget it (BLURRY - BLURRY - BLURRY).  Guess I should of went ultra professional and set up a tri-pod and lights just to get these seemingly simple pictures.  I will never buy another Olympus product.

The camera is very lightweight and small. It takes great pictures with only an occasional blurred picture which happens with any camera (usually due to user error). The start up time is only a second or two making it easy to capture something in a hurry. Also, the LCD screen is visible even in daylight. It is easy to use and provides explanations of what each mode is on the LCD screen when changed.

I own about 10 cameras. This is my second digital. The pictures are superb. The videos are great. It is so-so easy to carry around;fits in your pocket so you can take it anywhere "just in case". I highly recommend this camera to novices and experts alike.

This camera is NOT worth it. I recieved it for christmas and it is awful. The batteries that came with the camera only lasted for about 15 pictures, and since they weren't rechargable, they had to be thrown away. I then went and bought recharable batteries and they only last for up to 10 pictures. So basically if I want to use it, I have to carry around five sets of double A batteries. It is also a lot fatter than it looks in the picture so it is not easy to carry around. When it does work, the pictures are decent but it does horrible in low lighting. Disposable cameras are better than this and I do NOT recommend this product. Spend the extra 50 bucks for something good.

I just received my new Canon S5 IS camera; number 7 of many other Canons that I purchased for my family members. This one is for me as a replacement to the G6.  The S5 IS IS BY FAR an exceptional camera; ease of use, clarity of photos and Canon's "best value" for the 3 to 4 hundred price range.  Note: the recommended PSC 75 case DOES NOT FIT THIS CAMERA. In researching sites for a case for this model Canon, Amazon and other sites recommended the PSC 75. BUYER BEWARE this case does not fit the S5 IS . I order one from this dealer who has refused my full refund. Customer service rep or possibly the owner has been very nasty ! STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALER : newworldvideodirect.com

Other then a couple small issues, 1. having the ability to only upgrade from the built in 16MB to 1GB of memory, (tried putting a 2GB card in and it fails to recognize the card during format) and 2. Batteries too seem to be an issue. (it blows right through them so rechargeable would probably be the cheaper way to go)this has been a good camera for my daughter. The specifications say "SD/MMC card expansion slot" but what it doesn't say is that you can only expand to 1GB.  I now own a spare 2GB card that will use on a different camera. Great starter camera for both the young and older person in your life.

This camera was better than expected. The reviews on this site really helped, and I really enjoy this camera. The settings are really easy to use, and the pictures are really amazing! If you want a step up from a regular point and shoot digital camera and don't want to pay over $500, this is definitely the choice for you. I literally stuck the batteries in and began shooting, anybody can handle it, but it has enough settings to satisfy the aspiring photographer. Great choice for the price range, definitely.

This is a great camera.   I guarantee that you would absolutely love it.  It's small and sleek with a very large screen.  I have yet to use all of the features on the camera because I've only had it for about two weeks so far.  Only thing that I've noticed that you have to watch out for is when the camera is connected to your computer using the usb cable, it drains the battery very fast.  But overall it's great, I love it and you can't beat Amazon's price.  If you check any retail stores this camera is usually around $279.99.

Do not buy this camera, I repeat do not buy this camera! Just read the reviews and you'll know exactly what I mean. Lucky I got this piece of junk for Christmas, so I didn't spend a dime on it. I opened the package BEFORE reading any reviews. Now I wish I've read the reviews before opening the box. I don't care what setting you use, I tried them all and I have yet to take a picture any better than my cell phones camera. The lighting sucks, you either end up with dark pictures or super bright ones. I really wanted this camera to work, it looks sweet but sadly it can't take pictures.

The LCD screen is almost impossible to view in certain outdoor circumstances like previously mentioned.  I haven't toyed with it long enough to find a solution.  I love the fact that it is waterproof.  We have the underwater housing for scuba diving but if that ever leaked just a little, the camera would survive (unlike its predecessor).  We also handed it (minus the underwater housing) someone standing in the water to take pictures.  The smile on my face was from knowing that if the camera was dropped in the water by accident, it wouldn't matter.  I also enjoy the size, having brought it into venues where "no cameras allowed" is stated but not thoroughly enforced. :)

At first I was worried getting a camera with fewer features and less optical zoom than my last Canon, but now I am so glad I bought the SD1000. First of all, this camera is smaller than you think. It's smaller than my cell phone and fits inside iPod cases. So now I have a camera I really do take with me everywhere I go, even in my tiny purse. This results in a much higher quantity of photos being taken, and I love the quality of them, too. The optical zoom isn't large, but 7 megapixels means you can crop them all you want when you get home. The camera's on/off speed is very quick, which means you can capture pictures that you may have missed before. I love this camera.

i got this camera a couple weeks ago and have been toying with all the features on it. its got a lot of good stuff and im very happy with it. the main reason why i bought this camera over the PS SD630 was the time lapse video [cause im a big fan of time lapse] and the face detection. i could care less about megapixels. i dont print my pictures anyway, i have to resize them to put em on the web. the time lapse works great i did get some good cloud time lapse. shoot somethin and show it to your friends, theyll think your amazing. the face detection works rather well too. sometimes it gives out on me right when i try to focus, but the picture is still in focus. and it has a feature that right after you take a picture, it blows up certain parts of the pic so you can tell if its focused right. this is wonderful because i always check mine when lighting conditions arent too great, for the camera shake. i used the stitch assistant once also and it worked nicely. the software that comes with the cam puts it all together for you and blends it in well. the camera turns on fast also so say you see some weirdo on the corner, you could prob pull out the cam and get him fast.CONS:some bad times ive had with the camera are red eye, even though its turned on i still get red eye A LOT. but, good news is they have a red-eye tool built in to the camera and you can remove it after. another thing is when the 'battery is dying' image comes on the screen youll only get another 2 minutes tops with the cam before it shuts off. say you didnt use the cam for a few days and cant remember if its charged or not and it suddenly dies. bummer. im not one to charge my battery every night cause its bad for the battery if you dont drain it. ive never used a canon with image stabilization, but that would be nice to have. i dont think youll need it unless your shooting dark times anyway. ive also heard some others complain about the only 3x zoom, which would be nice to have more, but this is a small camera. where would they put more zoom on it?LAST,i got a sandisk 2gb ultra ll card for this and it holds 500+ photos, i would suggest one of those.

I bought this to replace an earlier model Canon PowerShot (which I gave to my husband). This one is much lighter because it only uses 2 AA batteries instead of 4 AA's like the older model. I sell on eBay & website and the colors, clarity, ease of use are excellent. I highly recommend this camera and would gladly buy another for myself or a gift.

This camera is great - a friend who is a photographer recommended the elph series to me a few years ago because he knew I was quite ignorant about cameras.  I bought one for my daughter and when I turned 50 this year bought this as a birthday present for me.  It takes great pics, so easy to use and I haven't yet had time to discover how to use the bells and whistles.  I would certainly recommend it to anyone who isn't an expert, like me.

This is a great camera for its price! It has tons of features that are fun and easy to use.  It also has multiple size settings for photos, which is helpful if you wish to save space on your memory card.  The smallest setting is all that is needed if you are not intending to print your pictures (i.e. if you're putting them on the web) and even at the highest quality setting for these you can still take about 55 (that's using the small memory card included)! For people printing a majority of their pictures, I would suggest purchasing a larger memory card. Batteries seem to last a decent amount of time during usage of the camera.  The coloring and quality of the images seems great!

I bought this Canon PowerShot A550 as an "update" for my Canon PowerShot A520.  I've been pleased with my good ol' 4-megapixel A520, so I figured I'd be able to jump right into the 7-megapixel A550 with no learning curve.Exactly as planned.  This camera takes good photos in a variety of conditions, and seems "quicker" than my A520 (quicker between-shot times).No surprises--it's a very-good camera.  Cheap, too!  Recommended.

This is my first Amazon.com reviews. Whenever I buy something for my family, I always go to amazon.com first before purchasing a product, the reviews ALWAYS help! Anyway, my sons are almost 7, 5 and almost 2.  My 7 and 5 year old son kept talking about getting a  digital camera all last year.  Finally the long wait came at Christmas day.  My husband did alot of research on cameras and all the kids camera reviews were poor, for they didn't last long and felt it wasn't worth the money to spend a cheap camera for them.  We bought a different kind of camera through Amazon, but when we got the product, it was too cheap, the buttons were impossible to push and the battery life was 5 minutes! Immediately we returned that product.  After doing research we were down to the Kodak C300 or C310.  We didn't buy Kodak C310 through Amazon, there was an awesome sale at Best Buy for this camera for $119.00 and we got a free Kodak Camera Dock Series 3 set ($70 retail value!) for this purchase!  It came with a camera dock, camera case, rechargeable battery and a tripod! This was the after Christmas sale 2005.I HIGHLY recommend this camera for kids who are ready for the real thing, after all younger children(ages 5 and up) are getting into the technology alot sooner than I did when I was their age. This camera is very simple, easy to follow and they are experts at it already after a week of using it.  The buttons are easy to follow (although, I think it helped that we already had a Kodak DX6490 camera, that they used from time to time) It prepared them to know how to use it.  We just ordered a new Kodak 64mb SD through amazon so they can take more pictures and take it to Costco to get prints! I am very pleased with this product and look forward to seeing what they take and how proud they are when they take these pictures! :) Happy New Year! Hope this helped you all out! (This is great for beginners too, not just for kids, Kodak has great cameras out there)

I bought the S5 about a month ago to use for a trip to Africa. I'm an amature who takes lots of pictures of family and travel sites, having used other compact and subcompact digital cameras before. I've used my new S5 frequently in the first few weeks and have been impressed with it's easy of use, breath of features and quality of pictures. The zoom works very well including the digital zoom giving a 48x view. The zoom bar in the viewer tells you when the digital zoom is starting to degrade the quality of the picture, a nice feature.The S5 takes great video: With the large capacity memory chips one can take a couple of hours! of video. You can choose the quality of video, there is a separate video button so you can start/stop quickly and you can zoom while in video mode, something I haven't seen on other digital cameras.The articulated display is a nice feature, both to protect the screen when not in use and to orient it anyway you want.The batteries seem to last a long time.This camera is packed with lots of functions, things you can change and display options (including a live histogram)that I'm still learning to us. But its very well designed all around: layout of buttons, depth of options, layout of display information, 'feel' of camera in you hands.Also, there are over a dozen, what I call, picture content pre-sets like landscape, portrait, sports and even one for fireworks, which I had a chance to try and got good results.My one minor complaint is the flash doesn't automatically pop open when needed, you manually have to open it.As you can see, I'm really pleased with the purchase. I'd recommend you take the time to study the manual to take advantage of all it's feature. I continue to be delighted as I try something new -- the time zone map, the histogram, the face recognition feature, videoing in macro mode -- I took some amazing shots and video of a catapiller no longer then an inch.

I haven't had this camera long, but I've already found all the positive reviews about it to be absolutely true. I had a cheaper, point and shoot digital camera before, but it's overall picture quality was grainy, and it was practically useless in indoor lighting situations. This camera takes bright, vibrant pictures indoors, and the 10x optical zoom is amazing. I took a zoomed in shot of my father from across the room, and the picture was as clear as if I had been standing next to him, even when the picture was printed at a size blown up to fill a letter-sized page.And for me in particular having being disabled, I greatly appreciate how light this camera is. With a little practice, I'll be able to handle this camera very well, which means that I finally have a camera that combines the power of an SLR and the ease of use of a point-and-shoot. And if you also purchase the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVSLRO">Joby GP1-00EN Gorillapod Flexible Tripod</a> like I did, this camera becomes even more accessible to those who have special physical needs. I'm so excited by this camera that I may even become an amateur photographer now.I cannot recommend the Fujifilm Finepix S700 any more highly. Do yourself a favor and check it out.

I really did some research on digital cameras, even tried out a Sony, but the Canon brand is by far one of the best.  I don't have to do a lot of thinking when snapping a picture with this camera, it does most of the work!  I like to be able to think about the compostion of my photo and not ISO, aperature, and all that jazz.  The settings make it so easy and the color of the photos turn out so true.  The digital zoom is great and will even alert you if the picture will come out blurry.  There are so many features on this camera, too many to list.  I even found a great deal at Best Buy on a 2 gig memory card, I get  over 1,000 photos with a high resolution!  It takes alkaline batteries, but I bought rechargeable ones and one charge lasts a long time.  I am sooo happy with this camera, I take it with me everywhere, even a couple of days to work.

This is my first digital camera. It can be used on fully automatic settings, fully manual, or a combination of auto and manual.  It's very versatile that way.  I didn't read the user manuals that came with it, I just started using it.  It took me about an hour of shooting and two sets of batteries to figure out all the different options and features it has.  So I'd say the controls are pretty easy to learn and understand.It's pretty easy on batteries, as long as you don't use the flash.  I put some cheaper Rayovac alkaline batteries (size AA) in it after the first set went dead and the camera has no problem with them.  The flash drains the batteries quickly though - I didn't count the number of photos, but I probably only got 20 or 30 flash photos before the "low battery" warning started blinking.  But the warning comes early - you can take another 15 or so photos after the low battery warning pops up.  I don't know how many it'll take without the flash, but it's a lot more than when you're using the flash.The upside is that this camera is VERY sensitive to light, so it hardly even needs a flash.  Frankly, as on most compact cameras, the flash sucks.  It's too bright and flattens images.  But if you have decent lighting indoors, the thing is so light sensitive it takes good photos without the flash.  I suppose you'd need the flash if you were taking photos inside someplace dark, like a pub or bar, but in places like houses where there are usually plenty of lights on, it does great without a flash.It'll record up to an hour of video on a 1G SD card, which is great, because it also has a mic that works perfectly so you get good audio too. The photos are great - crystal clear and sharp.  Most cameras come with a 3x optical zoom at this price, but this camera has a 4x optical zoom.  It really helps, especially when you can't simply step closer to your subject for some reason.Here's the one thing I didn't like about this camera.  Out of the box, on the fully auto setting, it takes very bright, sharp, and high contrast photos.  Great, right?  Unless you're taking pictures of people.  Few people look their best with their foreheads, cheekbones, and chins highlighted by bright, high contrast photos while their faces are somehow oddly flattened.  But if you play around with the manual exposure and color settings, you can pretty easily set it right so it takes normal looking pictures.  And because you can adjust only those setting you want to change, you can still benefit from the auto features you want to use.  Once I found the settings I liked, I left it that way and the camera remembers them, so it's still a point and shoot camera, but with my customized settings.It seems very sturdy, much more so than many of the cameras I looked at in stores before buying this one.  It's too heavy to carry in your shirt pocket, but it's no problem in a cargo pocket or in your pants pocket if you're wearing pants with big pockets.I think this is a high quality, versatile camera at a great price.  It's great in almost every way, but just be aware that there's a bit of a learning curve at the outset to find the combination of settings that'll allow you to produce more "natural" looking photos if that's important to you.

When you are looking for quality you must look at two things:  That the product do functions than you search, for the price than you may pay.  That is quality. It is very good camera for that price.  Only I recommend buy batteries rechargeable additional, because the normal batteries do not last long time.  But buy, with 5MP and 4x, is very good for most user.

I have had the camera for about 6 months and do not regret it a bit. That does not mean it is a perfect camera.   First of all here are the list of requirements I had when I was shopping for it.  #1) small  size #2) AA batteries #3) SD Card memory #4) 4MP or better  #5) $100-130 range #6) good battery life #7) no optical zoom #8) convenient and easy to use.  This camera hit on all cylinders and still does.  I know someone is going to say why no optical zoom???  Great question.  Start up time and shutter lag is much more pronounced with optical zoom. Also, the more reviews I read on cameras that were already above my price range the common phrase went something like "I XXXXXX and the lens won't work anymore XXXXX camera is dead" It seemed to be the fragile and weak point of the less expensive cameras. Optical zooms also increased my price range and battery drain.  When backpacking I do not want to pack more batteries. Would I have loved to have one of the credit card sized Exilim's with zoom and all?  Sure, they were too much money and besides this camera was going backpacking and all sorts of stuff it was likely to get beat up.  I wanted something solid and so far it is.  The things I discovered I like about this camera that I did not know before hand are #1) the software is the easiest and best I have ever encountered.  I did have some difficulty installing it.  One call to cust service and he walked me through the steps of how to shut down the conflicting application and install it and I have never had an issue yet.  I thought the simplicity and small size would be nice.   I underestimated how nice it is.  Because I can carry it anywhere and use it quickly and easily I take far more pictures.  My kids take far more pictures and they take great pictures.  My wife who could not use anything but a disposable point and shoot can use it.  If you have not figured it out, we like this camera.  Now a couple of things to balance out my review.  I bought the c310 Easyshare for my son.  In comparing photos I noticed a couple of things.  Some of my photos would be very contrasty and his would be more balanced and even.  I have read these cameras electronically boost color saturation and I think they went too far with it on my camera.  But still good pictures in most cases.  In low light I could not get it to take good pictures.  The flash reaches about 7-10 feet and then it was all black.  I found out if there was some light and I turned the flash off I would be able to get a picture and in some cases a good one.  I could not figure this out until I read that the ISO range is 100-400 with auto adjustment except in flash mode.  Then it locked at 140.  Problem solved.  Turn the camera on, push the flash control button 3 times to turn it off and it may take an OK picture. With the flash turned off atleast you have a chance. It still is not a good low light camera but most in this price range are not going to be.  That is a feature that costs more.  All in all, this camera is a keeper? YEP.  It will never be my only camera and it is not perfect, but for a small affordable camera that can go anywhere and be ready to use at a moment's notice it gets the job done.  It is not and never will be perfect nor will it be a professional photographers dream but it is mine and I like it.

I have a large Sony digital camera which I really like but I was looking for a small version that I could stick in my pocket.   This is a great little camera.   Really enjoy taking pictures with it.  Not sure how much I will want to use my larger Sony now that I have this one.

i was recommended the SD1000 from a buddy and i am VERY pleased with it.  it is by far the nicest point and shoot camera i have ever used.  it is tiny and light and has image stabilization capabilities.  ive taken amazingly good pictures while driving 70 down the highway.  i would HIGHLY recommend this camera to anyone looking for a camera to just toss in your pocket for random occasions.

I'm primarily a dSLR user, but wanted a camera that I can easily tuck into a pocket and grab snapshots while I'm travelling.  I had previously borrowed both an A710IS and a A540 from friends, and was happy with those.The A570IS is generally a very good camera.  The image stabilization allows me to take much better pictures.  The noise level is low.  The camera is compact, and the interface easy to use.My only complaint: battery life.  Several reviewers seem to be able to coax 400 pictures out of a single set of AA batteries.  Myself, I can usually only get about 100 shots out of it on fresh disposable AAs, less than that on 2500 mAh NiMH.  This with no flash, and IS set to "shoot only".  So, while I can easily tuck the A570IS into my pocket, I also have to make sure I have some AAs handy as well.

My 11 year old daughter did yardwork all spring to earn $$ for a decent digital camera.  We then studied reviews, and found the Canon PowerShot A460.  She has carried and used this camera non-stop for the past month, and it continues to stand up to abuses while taking photos better than my more expensive (older) Canon digital.  She loves it, and is the envy of her  group of 11 year old buddies.  They make movie shorts, take it to the beach and sleepovers, roll under the dog, etc.  The controls are intuitive, and under her own power she's figured out how to attach it to the TV to show off her work to family, download photos to our computer and send them to friends, send images to Costco for processing (with my permission), etc. I love that it used AA batteries.  This wonderful little camera is keeping her entertained and educated all summer.  Oh, and the photos really are amazing.

When I first opened the box I was surprised at how small this sd1000 is, even after reading all about it. This is an upgrade from the sd400 for me which I loved, but was getting old.It's very light as well. I find that the battery lasts through filling up my 1gig card. I do wish there was a battery strength indicator. If there is one that I don't know about, please  enlighten me.A cool feature that it has is in the review mode. If you are reviewing a picture and you are holding the camera horizontally the picture will view horizontally. If you turn the camera vertically the picture will rotate itself as well.

I bought this camera for my technologically-challenged parents. I normally have to explain things to them at least 5 times before they get it, but this they actually were able to figure out on their own after we went over it once. I can't say how it works on a day-to-day basis as I am not the primary user, but they have been happy with it, no complaints, and the prints they've made from it have been great in terms of color, clarity, focus and sharpness. Which is impressive, considering the poor lighting and conditions they've taken the photos in. It's definitely not an advanced loaded-with-features camera, but it has more than enough to satisfy those who just want an easy to use camera that takes a decent picture.

I just bought this camera from amazon last week and I love it. Its slim, sleek and works great. I wasn't even looking for digital cameras but I was at Target one day in the electronics department and came across this beautiful camera. I decided to see if I could find it cheaper on Amazon than Target and I did. I am extemely happy with it. My pictures come out awesome and I love all the features of the camera. It has mode you can put it in exclusively for taking pictures for auctions so it automatically puts the picture in auction size. This feature really helps if you sell a lot on ebay. Overall I have no complaints about this camera.

For a camera less than $100 it's cool. Got me some very clear and sharp pics too, even after zooming. I only wish the video recording had a sound input port even if no built-in mic. Overall - excellent! Good value for the money.

I've taken several hundred pics already and love it.  Its pretty sinmple to use and switching from auto to the multiple preset modes is easy.  I love the fact that you can see the speed and f.stop when the shutter button is partially depressed.  This tells me what sort of focusing (f.stop function) I can expect and I can decide if the f.stop need to be adjusted a little.  The battery life is great too.  It survived several road trips.  I haven't taken very many flash pics, so not sure what to expect here, but so far, great camera.  Big screen is nice too, pics are sharp on it.

I recently purchased the Kodak C310/Easy Share printer dock.  This was my first purchase of a digital camera.  As my children have labeled be "electronically challenged", I was looking for something very simple to use, yet producing great pictures.  I found exactly that with the C310. The instructions were very understandable for both the camera and the printer dock, and I was up & running in a very short time.  Excellent choice for the first-time buyer.

im an ocasional picture taker...so im fine with the picture quality, pics look great to me! only 1 problem...after 3 months of use...it broke down becasue the lens failed to open so it would not power on, it displayed some error codes on the screen, but i sent it to olympus, and they got it fixed in no time at no charge...camera is in great working condition now, if it were not for that problem, it would have gotten 5 stars...another minor complaint is that it does not always show battery power, setting these things aside...it is a great, nice, small camera that will satisfy any customer like me.

I decided to get one of the new Stylus cameras as my old camera was dying and the new ones are water resistant (supposedly waterproof to ten feet). I do a lot of canoeing and I believe that dampness hastened the demise of my previous camera.The camera takes excellent pictures and the 4 power optic zoom works quite well. I have used it for indoor and outdoor pictures. While it is not as versatile as the SLR types, it is good for quick pictures which is mostly what I take these days. It does have a fair amount of versatility, but it takes a bit of time to adjust.The only downside I have found on the camera is that it does not have a viewfinder, only the screen which tends to wash out in bright light. This has not posed a serious obstacle to any pictures I have taken to date, but it does restrict the ability to finely compose a picture. If this issue could be resolved, I would have absolutely nothing but good things to say about this unit.

This was my first digital camera and I though I was getting a good deal because it was by Polaroid. Well, I was wrong and if this is the quality I get from a Polaroid digital camera, they need to stick to - well - Polaroids. Not only was the picture quality horrible, but the images took up so much memory I had to constantly upload the images to my computer before I left to go do something. The battery life is terrible and to be honest, the charging dock is pointless when you can just plug it directly into your computer via cable. It takes horrible pictures in the dark and the flash produces nothing but a blank, white image. If there's one thing I've learned, it's you get what you pay for and a quality camera is going to cost some extra. I've since bought a Kodak digital camera for about $200 and it is wonderful! Don't waste your money on this sorry excuse for a digital camera, instead, save for a better one. Not even worth giving to a 6-year-old as a gift.EDIT: I just now looked at the price on this thing. $100?! Are you kidding me!? I bought this camera at Wal-Mart something like 3 years ago and it was only $25! Even at that price it is a huge waste of money! I could have fed starving children in Africa! If you just want to get rid of $100, donate it to a charitable foundation, not to Polaroid!

Bought this as an upgrade to my older 2.1mp canon camera, and was not disappointed. Even with 1600x1200 resolution images (good enough for 4x6 prints) I can get 3600+ on a 2GB card which was more than enough for a 2 week vacation. I could also easily change resolutions for those times when I needed the extra resolution.One plus I found was being able to use regular AA batteries, even though the batteries I had died, I could replace them easily and kept shooting, something I could not do with my other camera which had a special rechargeable battery and charger.Another thing I was surprised was the 16x (combined 4x optical and 4x digital).  Even though I was far away, I could still get a decent picture that was not all that degraded, a substantial gain from the 5x (optical + digital) from my older camera.

Unfortunately or Fortunately, I briefly owned a Canon SD630.  After it was lost/stolen, I began searching for a new digital camera.  Canon's are great cameras, but they usually underacheive inside...i.e. low light situations.  Bottom Line, the A570is isn't the best camera in low light situations.  However, it's a great all around point and shoot.  The greatest advantages over the SD630 are the image stabalizer, zoom (to include digital), face finder, overall comfort/feel, ability to add lenses and 2xAA batteries.  Only negative of camera is the time to recharge flash (flash works very well though).

This is only the 2nd Digital camera I have bought.  The first one was one of the first models HP put out.  Digital cameras have come a long way since then, and this one is exactly what I wanted.  It is easy to use, has some nice advanced features, a very good battery life, and with a 2 GB memory card it can hold over 2,000 pictures.  I thought about a larger camera with more features, but after seeing what this little gem will do I am fully satisfied.  I bought a SanDisc card reader and an Epson PictureMate printer (for less than $100 total cost) and now I can snap a picture, load it on my computer, and print a copy in a couple of minutes.  The camera will fit easily into a shirt pocket or carried in a belt holder so it always handy and ready.  The quality of the pictures from this camera is flat out wonderful.

I bought this camera few days ago and I love it.It has a great lens with 10x zoom plus 5x digital. Shoot nice pics even high ISO.I use SD Elite Pro 50x and its great. Dont buy faster memory.SLR style is amazing. Nice colour and 2.5' LCD make big difference between Fuji and other similar cameras.Also, uses 4 AA batteries, so if you need replace them, you can buy anywhere without a problem.I buy a CaseLogic TBC-4 bag and its great. I recomend it.Well...I choose 5 starts because i cant choose 10 !!Enjoy it!

This thing rocks. It's fast and takes great pictures. Lots of features (many of which I still have to try). The red eye fixer is great. The screen on the back is big and clear. I bought one for my in-laws, and loved it so much I got one for myself, and a friend liked mine so much he bought one, too! It powers on and is ready to shoot in like, a second, so you'll never miss that shot (as long as it's not in the case).I highly recommend ordering a 2GB (or bigger?) SD card, the one the camera comes with is a joke. So far, that's the only weakness.

This is my 5th digital camera and I've chosen it as my favorite! Unlike other cameras on the market, the SD1000 is convenient and easy to use, well built, and takes AMAZING pictures! I recommend using the cannon software provided for the best results when transferring pictures from your camera to your computer. iPhoto did nothing for my shots!

This is simply a great camera to get whether you are buying a digital camera for the first time or the fifth time. Why? Because you get all the Canon quality and features for a very good price. At this price you can afford to even gift it to a teenager who wants to learn a little more photography as it offers a little more than just point and shoot.I've owned about 4 A series cameras in the past, along with S2/S3 series and SD series and I still recommend A series as the best value for money based on its performance. I tried this particular camera when I bought it recently for a gift.  Although the size of A series cameras is bigger than SD series making them jacket-pocket cameras, the advantage is in the styling. It gives you a convenient grip on the side which helps hold the camera steady and results in less "blurry" pictures than SD. The mode selector dial on top helps you zip through selections from portrait, landscape to nightshot and special scenes. The convenience of AA batteries which are available in every corner of the world, no missing out on pictures as your battery was discharged, is a great convenience. You can buy 2NiMH batteries with a charger like I did, and never have to buy any more again. The screen is only 2 inch (up from 1.8 earlier) but it makes the camera more durable, as the design makes it more resistant to damage.And what about the features? :- It has an intelligent 9 point focusing system with auto red eye correction which means it can choose the focus pretty accurately, although it also gives you the flexibility to choose the focus through 3 modes. (Centered, Evaluative, Spot) - SD card/MMC card slot - These cards are so cheap now so get the 2GB to store a whole vacation's worth of pictures.-Pic size- You can choose from 6 sizes for the pics including a widescreen 16:9 format which can be viewed on your HDTV.-Speed Dial: This dial on top allows fast spinning between shooting modes (night, landscape, indoors, kids, portrait, movie, auto, manual, special) so you never miss a shot. For this feature alone, I'd prefer an A series over SD as I keep missing shots on SD series while trying to change modes through the menu. With this dial even a kid becomes a pro. The SCN(special scenes) mode has Fireworks, Foliage, Beach, Snow, and Night Scene. Now even amateurs can use Canon experience to get the best shot. Fireworks is particularly amazing as it produced some great 4th of July shots. This camera does not have the Photostitch mode found on some other cameras but it does have the macro mode to take close ups.-Special effects (B/W, Sepia, Vivid, Nuetral etc.) I've used sepia a lot when taking potraits giving them an 'old world' feel. Vivid has been helpful in special situations like a red kite against a blue sky to bring out the colors. You can do this in Photoshop later but how many of us actually get the time to do this, once a pic is taken it's over with for me! This camera does not have the color accent/color swap option which is available on some other Canons.-You can set white balance manually on this camera or manually adjust shutter or aperture priority. It also has an optical viewfinder which is handy for very dark/very bright situations.-You can also take videos in 3 different resolutions with this camera and edit them right on the camera. -The zoom button shows one or many images at a time in the replay mode and you can zoom into each individual image to see parts of it closely. - While replaying, the images auto-rotate to landscape or portrait mode to align with how you're holding the camera. It's a nice feature as otherwise you can't see the portrait shots properly in the landscape mode. This camera makes a great first camera, with many features, and the image quality is superb. Especially if you are shooting outdoors the images are unsurpassed by any other brand, in my opinion. So go get it, at this price it's well worth getting it as a second camera for another member of your family during the vacation. You won't mind taking this one on the ride where you'd be scared to take your more expensive cameras!

This is my first digital camera ever purchased and i love it.  I did a couple of months of research and found this camera to fit my needs.  I have had a lot of camera interaction through friends and family so I can definately tell the difference in picture quality.  There are many different features and it seems like I everytime I play with it I find a new feature.  Good camera and I'm looking forward to all the future pictures I will take.

I bought a Canon A570 for my mother and she loves it; and this week I bought another one for my best friend for her birthday.  Even though I also recently purchased an Canon S5 IS for myself and will be ordering the Canon 40D soon (for more serious shots), I still plan on picking up one more A570 for myself because I like it so much.

I cant say enough about the ease of operation, and results of this camera... The photos are superb, and it handles nicely. I cant wait to get the telephoto conversion lens for it.Not to be advised, but It dropped off my side table without the case and was none the worse for wear, thank goodness. A sturdy camera well worth the price.

Canon's PowerShot A550 is a simple, inexpensive 7-megapixel camera, and that's all it wants to be. While it has some nice features, it doesn't offer any outstanding, unique aspects that put it above any other camera in the field, and that's just fine. Good performance and solid images are all a camera needs to succeed, and the A550 delivers just that. Though not quite small enough to slip into your jeans, the A550 is still comfortably compact. At 7.4 ounces and 1.7 inches thick, the camera can fit easily into most jacket pockets and bags. The camera's body has an L-shaped design found on most of Canon's PowerShot A series, giving it a generous grip. The buttons are large and comfortable, and they're laid out logically along the back and the top of the camera. The A550 is a fairly nondescript camera, with few outstanding or unusual features. Its most notable attribute is its 35mm-to-140mm-equivalent 4X zoom lens, which gives it just a bit more range than the 3X lenses typical of most budget cameras. It has a smaller-than-usual 2-inch LCD screen that is augmented by an optical viewfinder for shooting in dim light. Besides those features, the A550 has the standard handful of scene presets and image adjustment settings, including a 30fps VGA (640x480) movie mode and a pleasantly unexpected 60fps QVGA (320x240) high-speed movie mode. Finally, like most Canon PowerShot A-series cameras, the A550 conveniently takes AA batteries. The A550 performed well in almost all of our Labs' tests. After its brisk start-up time of 1.5 seconds, we could snap a shot once every 1.7 seconds, a great improvement over previous PowerShot A5x0 cameras. Unfortunately, with the onboard flash enabled, that time more than tripled to 4.9 seconds per shot. The camera's shutter was responsive, lagging less than 0.5 seconds with our high-contrast target and a modest 1.2 seconds with our low-contrast target. Burst mode was also pleasantly fast, managing 51 full-resolution shots in 31.4 seconds for a rate of 1.6 frames per second. Photos looked pretty good, though they're marred by overprocessing and fringing in spots. Colors reproduce well, though indoor photos shot with automatic white balance come out very yellow, a common problem for most snapshot cameras. Noise is low up to ISO 400 sensitivity, where a fine grain starts to appear. Images are predictably noisy at ISO 800 sensitivity, with speckling damaging fine details and softening colors. ISO 800 is usually reserved for low-light and high-speed shooting, and everyday snapshots shouldn't have many problems. With quick performance and decent photos, the Canon PowerShot A550 is a solid budget camera. It doesn't have many special features and it's not particularly small or light, but it's a strong choice if you don't want to spend a lot for your snapshots.

I've been playing with this camera for the last 2 days. It has rich features packed in it and lightweight. Based on the pictures that I took, I feel you have to know how to use Manual setting to get better pictures. Several shots were taken outdoor with ISO 80 in P mode didn't look good (it was a little bit cloudy that day). I didn't want to bump up the ISO to more than ISO 200 (this camera has grainy problems on higher ISO values). Then I took several shots with Manual mode with the same ISO, changed shutter speed and set appropriate aperture, the pictures look very nice. [...].I can't complain too much about low LCD resolution or low battery efficiency. This camera is pretty cheap ($179) and has some nice features.Overall is a good buy for somebody that wants to learn Manual setting.UPDATE: 09/08/07The more I use this camera, the more I feel bad buying an SLR :(. This camera has so much on it. I wish I hadn't spent so much money on an SLR.

This is my first digital camera.  After speaking to a friend who has sold cameras in the past, I was advised to go with a canon because they all have a glass lens instead of plastic.  I find this camera very easy to use.  After reading the owners manual only once I am able to use the manual settings easily.  The only problem I have had, is that when I use manual mode and zoom in on anything, I tend to get blurry pictures.  I'm assuming this is a problem with me not the camera.  I may need to adjust shutter speed in some of these modes.  I purchased lithium batteries and have been pleased with the battery life. The software is easy to use, and uploading pictures to my computer and the internet has been easy.  I have not printed any yet.  My sister also has a canon powershot, the one she has is 5 megapixels and she is just as pleased as I am with my 7.1 megapixel.  I think this camera was great deal for the price.

I thouht going with Olympus, I'd get quality and innovation.  I thought wrong.  The first camera had a crack in the screen right out of the box.  After returning I used for just a couple of weeks before a flash malfunction, which eliminated indoor photo's.  Photo's were frequently out of focus and images taken with slight motion was blury.  Don't waste your time thinking that this small camera will be a good pocket camera, it won't.  What it will do is break and disappoint.

This is an incredible value, and shoots better pics than my $400 Canon from just a few years back. Pick up the 4gb card and you can shoot high def videos for 31 minutes on a battery! Simple upload to computer, can't say enough about this camera. Just buy it.

Bought this for my non tech savy wife, and have been using it until I can afford a better digital SLR myself. Surprisingly this camera for the 150.00 we spent is very good. There is some minor distortion (grain) on some photos that the camera pushed to extreme auto ISO settings, but for normal point and shoot, you can't beat this for the money. The controls are well laid out and easy to use, even quickly without having to page through settings. The Auto setting works great for 90% of the photos shot, and then the other settings work even better. I shot my kids outdoors during sunset and into the night with the KIDS AND PETS setting and got awesome still mid air shots of them diving off the diving board in the dark! The flash caught them and the shutter speed was fast enough to freeze the action even in the dark. The movie mode was grainy in the dark-which is to be expected, but quite usable under normal circumstances. I have used Picasa software (free download) to store my shots and the only real editing I have been doing is sharpening them in the dark photos. Other than that, everything has been pretty good on its own. I am picky on using cameras and for the cost of this one, I can't complain. It fills a much needed void. My only complaint is I wish it had a bit more zoom (maybe 5x instead of 4)and a slightly wider angle for wide angle shots, but that's being extremely picky. Definately worth the money!

I love this camera and wanted to say that the display is so bright that you can use it in sunlight. People who complained about no peephole viewfinder are just refusung to accept progress. This is better and there is just no need for squinting through a peephole that may not be accurate. You can even brighten the display momentarily by pressing one button. Also the battery life is amazing. In spite of the brightly lit display, you can take hundreds of pictures without recharging

I agree with all the positive review.I'm a Sony used since the very first digital cam but Canon is just simply better.And also agree that the biggest problem is really that the Optical cover is very loose, seems a minor issue but is really a pain!I hope CANON will plan an exchange in guarantee.The Optic of this camera is impressive, the 12x zoom is a dream even if your really need a firm hand.I love it!Goodbye Sony

I love everything about my canon powershot sd1000. It does everything I expected plus more. The battery lasts longer than I thought and I was able to find an extra battery for under $13.00. You will need to purchase a bigger memory card. I was able to get a 2 gig card on sale for $19.95. Love it!!!

This camera replaces the S300 series Canon with 3.1MP for me.The SD750 was chosen especially for it's large 3-inch screen (even larger than the 2.5 inch on the SD1000; and, the quality and positive experience I have had with former Canon cameras.The camera works beautifully. The red-eye fixing feature seems very useful as well as the 3X optical zoom.This camera does not have the picture stitch feature for super wide shots.  I found this feature of very limited value anyway.  The one feature I would have preferred is the option to view the picture through a small optical viewer when sunlight conditions make the viewing screen hard to see.  This camera does not have this, and it was not mentioned in any of the comparisons I read before purchasing.

The Canon Powershot is a great camera that takes quality pictures.  I carry my camera everywhere I go and I couldn't be happier with it.  Other people compliment my camera all the time, and after buying my camera, three other people bought one similiar to mine and they all love theirs as well.  The features on the camera are outstanding and easy to use.

This camera has so many functions. The mega pixels are GREAT for such a tiny camera! I have a digital rebel already, and wanted something small to put in my purse and go to the beach or to the club with and it now everybody makes me use my camera for group shots because they always turn out great!

I found the image quality to be pretty good, as was the ease of operation.  It won't give the same quality as a DSLR, but then again that wasn't what I bought.  I wanted something light that I could carry with me anywhere, that has the flexibility to take a variety of pictures.  It does this nicely.  What I like best about this camera is the video function.  There three versions of video recording--e-mail, standard and fast.  I have used the e-mail version to put little videos on my website with very good results.  The e-mail version's picture quality isn't so nice, since it is a smaller version, but it's bearable.  The standard version--has a very good quality picture, and I have used it numerous times by now.  I have a 2G card in the camera, and have not used it up yet.  Negative--not so good in low-light conditions, since the image becomes very noisy.  Best to use inside/light or outside conditions.

This is a great little camera - very lightweight, but just large enough for older fingers to grip easily. It's easy to use and takes fabulous photos = large enough to reproduce nicely in prints (we old folks still like prints, dontcha know.) I would recommend this camera. Buying from Amazon was fast, easy and a bargain price.

I bought this camera when I need to update from an old HP digital camera.  I have been doing store surveys on hurricane damaged stores, so I need a camera that was easy to use, easy to carry, and   could take good detailed pictures.  I decided on a kodak because I like to size of it and I had SD memory cards already.  I like that it is so easy to use, if you need to take a picture that is a lower quality pictures so it is easier to email, it only take a few seconds to change it on the camera.  The camera will easily fit in a shirt pocket.  It takes quality pictures, and you do not have to be perfectly still, the pictures come out great.  I use the camera with the screen cut off, so I can save the 2 AA batteries.  I have taken over 100 pictures, reviewed them, and transfered them to my laptop on a single set of batteries.  Overall if you want a easy to use camera, that will not cost you an arm and a leg this is a great little camera to think about.

I think this is a great camera. It takes nice shots and probably even better ones then I have been taking since I have yet to use all of the different modes and features that it comes with.  My only real problem with this camera is there isn't a view finder just a screen which is impossible to see if the sunlight hits it. So, you find yourself aiming and shooting and praying you got the shot. Out of direct sun it is great. If they could just add a view finder it would be perfect!

I needed a small shirtpocket camera and was looking at Canon, Casio and Nikon cameras at the local Wal Mart.  I came across an ad for the Olympus Stylus 770SW.  While I was on the internet looking at the 770SW I saw the Olympus Stylus 750; it appeared to be just what I was looking for--it is an all weather camera with 5X zoom, and CCD shift image stabilization as opposed to the phony digital image stabilization.  It takes outstanding pictures, the image stabilization works great.  The 5X optical zoom (180mm equivalent) and macro mode takes great pictures of butterflies, flowers, etc., with very little cropping required.  The only drawback is viewing with the LCD; it is very difficult to use in direct sunlight.  I would much rather have a viewfinder, but, I guess they have to eliminate the viewfinder to keep the camera small.

I'm far from knowledgable about photography, and needed to finally upgrade to the digital age from my 20-year-old Fuji DL-400 Tele 35mm (which still works great, by the way, it's just so big and heavy by comparison.)  I got this camera last month after a lot of research and most particularly after the excellent detailed review/comparison by Paul Christensen here on Amazon.  Although I still haven't figured everything out yet, I love it.  It's a great camera, and I can't get over how tiny and lightweight it is!  One thing I would recommend -- be sure to get some sort of carrying case.  I intended to get one "later" and now I'm sorry I didn't do it right away -- I've already scratched the LCD screen from carrying it one time in my purse, which I didn't think had anything in it that would scratch.  Oops.  My own fault.  So be sure and get the case for it -- they're certainly cheap enough here on Amazon.

I purchased this camera for my 6 yr old daughter. It isn't even good enough for a child's toy camera! She had asked for a camera with a flash and screen for viewing what she had taken photos of. This camera looked like it would fit the bill. It was small and "cool" looking, had a dock (great idea), Li-ion battery (great idea) and a skin (great idea.) Unfortunately it lacks the ability to take decent photos in varied environments (We are not always outside in the sun!) If they would put a better camera in the same package it would become very desirable.Save yourself the grief and buy something else. I'm getting a 5MP HP (for less money even!)

For a camera with 6MP and a good LCD screen, this is a good buy. Pictures are crisp and the camera is easy to use. Does not get 5 stars because it's using batteries like crazy. I recently bought rechargeable ones for it and the situation improved, but I only use the camera occasionally (weekends, for maybe 10-20 pictures) and the batteries are not lasting longer than a week.

A friend of mine recommended this Canon PowerShot.  She has a SD600 and when I found the SD1000 she was impressed.  It is everything she said it is.  Point and shoot and the quality of the pictures is outstanding.It is very user friendly.  I appreciate that, being 'technically challenged'.  I figured out the video feature without the booklet.  Now that's easy.I would recommend it to anyone.

Amazon provides the fastest shipping service. I ordered and received both the 570IS and Kingston 4G card in 24 hours.I primarily use my SONY U-20 and camcorder in this past four years.  Now I can simply carry my new Canon.  My observations are:1. The charging time varies from 3 to 6 seconds on a pair of old 2100 mAH batteries.  2. The two modes that I used are Auto and Movie.  I am very happy with the results. They were all taken indoor with heavy curtain and no artificial lighting. 3. Using the stitch function and Canon's software to make panoramic photograph is extremely easy.4. Transferring pictures between the camera and my ancient PC is very easy using the provided USB cable.

We bought our German exchange student a digital camera for Christmas. It was a different make, and it lasted all of four months before heading to the great recycling center in the sky. When I discovered the camera we had bought only had a 3 month warranty, I felt badly and decided to get her a replacement that might actually last for a decent period of time.After researching various cameras, I discovered this particular camera. It was the right price, had similar features to the one we had previously given her and it had a 1 year warranty. Also, the warranty is good worldwide, allowing her to get warranty service in Germany if it becomes necessary. That is not a common feature in other makes.After several weeks of use, she is thrilled with the way it works. It takes wonderful pictures for a point and shoot, and is constructed of far better materials than similar priced cameras. I will admit that it does take a little while to record a picture, and it does inhale batteries, but these are problems that we saw in her previous camera, and I think are a function of the price. Overall, for the price and type of camera, we are extremely happy and would buy another Samsung camera in a flash. If you are looking for a sophisticated camera, look elsewhere, but if you want a quick point and shoot camera, this is an ideal choice.

I just received my new C310 and printer dock a couple of days ago and I just love it!  It takes really good pictures, nice and clear.  I haven't had a problem with the batteries running down quickly. :::knocking on wood:::  The printer prints a lot better than I expected.  I haven't had to buy paper or ink for it yet so I don't know how much that's going to run me, but I'm not going crazy printing pictures either.  I like that you can charge the included camera batteries on the printer dock as well.  It's small enough to drop into a purse and that's a big + in my opinion. I wish the video option included sound, but the videos even look pretty good on the computer.  Overall, it's a great, inexpensive digital cam!

overall i love the slim, sleek look, very efficient. However, sometimes the pictures become blurry, when taken and i thought it would be good w/ a little shaky hands, but apparently not.  the picturn quality when taken w/o shaky-ness is absolutely wonderful. i don't like that i have to turn to play mode in order to delete the pic. the camera allows a short viewing time before going back to camera mode after each shot and it doesn't let you delete unless you go into pic mode.  i like the features and the easy usage. its a good, play camera.  the price isn't too bad for what i got. the time it takes to take the actual picture is somewhat slow as well, which makes me a little disappointed. overall besides minor problems it's a good camera.  final verdict: I would still buy a sony camera over an olympus. yes the price is a bit steeper, but it's a better quality. Sony does a great job with its cameras.

Best camera in this price class. The IS feature is amazing, must have feature. The only complaint is the flash recharge time is a little slow due to 2 AA batteries. If you take lots of indoor pics, go for the Canons with 4 AA batteries (A6xx). For sports and kids this a great camera.

I've had this camera for a few days, I can say that I'm really satisfied with the pictures taken. I've had to play around with the settings to get the right shots indoors. Outdoors and Macro shots are great, crystal clear shots. My last camera was the bulkier Canon s450 5mp, and I really like this camera better with the exception that I had more manual controls on my canon. Overall it's a great value for those of us who just want to capture family gatherings and vacations. Oh, I almost forgot, Sony has there own cable connection you need to use, don't like that either

I purchased this camera for 2 main reasons. First, my old camera was also an Olympus, and it took great photos. Second, I wanted a weatherproof camera that I could take to the beach. Unfortunately, the pictures from this camera appear somewhat grainy and washed-out on average, despite the impressive megapixels. I saw that the camera didn't have a viewfinder, and I thought, "that's probably not a big deal." WRONG. A viewfinder is absolutely necessary - don't buy a camera without one. In bright sunlight (i.e. at the beach)you cannot see a thing on the 750's LCD screen. It's useless. I have learned several reasons why a viewfinder is so wonderful:1. You can see through it no matter the level of light2. It allows you to rest the camera on your nose for stability, rather than always having to hold it awkwardly in front of you3. It allows you to properly frame a photograph without other visual distractionsI will be buying a second camera WITH a viewfinder. This camera will just have to serve as a sort of sport camera - one I can use when the weather is dangerous for a good camera.

I first want to say the camera is great and takes awesome pictures.  However, both the first camera and replacement camera I received had a defective sensor that would cause a small dark spot on the upper right quandrant of the picture in certain conditions.  Those conditions were whenever the aperture was in the range of f6 - f8 (small aperture).  This aperture setting would usually occur under bright conditions (auto) or manually set.  The spot looks like a dried water spot on the lens.  If you have this camera, check your pictures for this and test it yourself.  The spot may not be in the same area as mine, so look at the whole picture.  The easiest way to test yours is to point your camera against a light background, such as a blue sky, set the dial to Av, and set your f-stop to f-8.0.  Depress the shutter button half-way and look for a spot on your LCD.  Take a picture also, to confirm it shows up on the picture too.  In both cases my lens was completely clean.  I suspect that either there was a bad batch of sensors on the assembly line or these cameras that Amazon are selling were refurbished to some extent.  That might explain the $[...] rebate that Amazon is able to offer.  I hope that this is not the case as I have enjoyed doing business with them on many occasions in the past.

I bought until now 3 of Olympus Stylus 710, one for me, and after using it i bought two for my two sisters, and eevrytime i bought one i went through all the brands and model, i couldn't find any with too many modes as this one, i had a Sony digital cam before and once it get a knock on the lence, it stop working, even in the store , the displayed one was the same probem , even it was a newer model than the one i had.and my advice you do not need too many pix. because it will be very hard to send them by email, and normaly i zip the file and with that also you can not send too many.

I bought this camera for a trip my husband and I took to Scotland and England in May.  Since this was our first digital camera, I researched many different brands and decided on this one because of the price, the actual pictures other users had uploaded and the reviews.  We were not disappointed at all!  It was so easy to use - we just left it on auto and it chose all the perfect settings - we've also gotten so many compliments on the quality of the pictures!  We used a 2gb memory card and chose lithium batteries.  We took over 400 pictures and didn't fill up the card and didn't wear out the batteries which is excellent considering we were gone for 12 days!!  I highly recommend this camera to anybody but especially first time digital camera users.

It's hard to pick the actual rating for this camera, and I guess your user experience will depend on what you bought this camera for. After using it for a month, I don't feel this is the "one and only" camera someone would want to own. The reasons: 1) The pictures just aren't coming out all that great, and are often blurry 2) Impossible to take pictures outside in the daylight, no matter how hard you try you can't see the screen in the daylightHeres why it got 3 out of 5 stars though... this camera has a perfect "niche" if you will. We recently had a very cold, wet snowy weekend in Texas. Since that doesn't happen in my area very often, I wanted to take a bunch of pictures. Well guess who was the only person who could take their camera out in the wet snowy environment? Me! Everyone else was afraid their camera would be ruined. Since the sun was not shining, I could see the view finder just fine, and even though it was getting wet from the snowflakes landing on it, I knew the unit was sealed and weatherproof.  It took good pictures in these conditions, and the camera wasn't harmed at all. This camera is also great for party settings, it can sit on the table and you can spill beer after beer and not worry about it. So IMO this is a good "secondary" camera to have around. If you're looking to buy only one camera, this isn't it.

I bought this camera a few weeks ago and after using it a couple times, it just stopped working out of the blue. It turns on, but it won't take pictures or let me view pictures. A friend of mine also bought this camera and we were both excited because I had a red one and she, a black one and she experienced the same problem. She even went out of her way to contact Samsung and get another Samsung camera with the result being that the same thing happened again. All in all, I think this brand must be bad in general or the model is. Either way, I don't recommend this camera AT ALL. I wasted around $100 and now I have to go buy a new camera.

I purchased this camera for my sixteen year old niece.  It's only a 3.2MP so the picture quality isn't as good as a 5.0MP, however, 3.2MP is above average quality.  This is a great starter camera for a young person or teenager.  It's compact, has easy to use menu items, and a cool charger base.  The batteries run out a little too fast but so do the ones in my expensive 5.0MP camera.  It's the nature of the beast...The person who wrote the review about the pictures being to dark didn't turn on the flash.  The flash must be turned on in low light.  If they had read the directions, they would have figured that out.  Once the flash is turned on the pictures come out perfect.Don't hesitate to buy this affordable camera for someone as a starter.  It is a great device.I gave this "4" stars because of the price, features, and slim body.  I thought "5" stars was too high because it is not for a serious picture taker, it's a great "first" camera.

Purchased this camera because of the features, low cost, and brand reliability.  The large LCD screen is easy to see, even in bright sunlight.  The picture quality is comparable to much more expensive camera setups.  The camera is so easy to use, the only thing we referenced the manual on was how to attach the neck strap.

I bought this camera to replace a Nikon Coolpix 4 that I broke.  Even though this camera is much newer and the the same price, the quality of the photos was worse (especially when I focused on an object in the foreground).  The pictures weren't terrible and it was easy to use, but so was my old Nikon.  I returned this camera, and plan to buy a newer Nikon Coolpix.

This camera has more capabilities than I will probably need, but at the same time, it is simple to use. Combined with the Kingston 4GB SD Flash Card, you can take a ton of pictures. And since it uses just two AA batteries, you can easily carry a few extra with you and never have to worry about recharging. And of course, it's a Canon. I love this camera!

I just returned from a business trip to Vermont. I had promised my daughter a picture of the snow and forgot my camera. I went to Walmart and was going to buy a disposable when I saw the iZone 300 and decided to buy it for the trip and then give it to my daughter. I went back to the hotel and looked up reviews on it before opening the box. After reading the reviews on this site I almost returned it before trying it out. However, since I had a week and nothing to lose I figured I'd give it a try and then return it before I left if it was as sucky as some of the reviews indicated. I honestly cannot find anything wrong with this camera. It is everything it claims to be and then some. It took absolutely amazing pictures and when I used the flash it worked flawlessly. It says right in the instructions to use the flash only at a distance of 3-6 meters. If you use this camera exactly the way it represents itself in the manual you will be delighted. If you expect more than what it is designed to do or do not use it as directed it will possibly dissapoint you. But, even then you've got to get your monies worth from it. It is a steal at the $78.00 I paid for it. Now that I am home and my daughter is using it she is delighted with it also. She is 10 and taking excellent pictures with it and finds it very easy to use. I highly recommend this camera to anyone wanting an inexpensive camera that's simple to use and takes outstanding pictures.

We wanted a camera that uses AA batteries (for convenience) and is easy to hold (for my young children when they take picture of us) so we bought this camera. I had a Canon Powershot A80 and liked the picture quality  but it broke after three years of use. The A80 was quite expensive at that time so I hesitate to get another point-and-shot that priced at the higher-end. We are very satisfied with the price, the picture quality, and the functions of the A550. The only shortcoming of the A550 I noticed so far is that the recharge of the flash is quite slow (even with full battery) so there is a longer-than-usual wait time before you can take the next picture after using flash.

I had high hopes with the IS and 1600iso, but I think we got a defective copy: - The shutter button had to be pressed very hard to take a photo. - There was a lot of shutter lag when it did press.  - Flash recharge was very slow.- All photos blurry.Maybe the IS or chip was defective. I returned it for an A560 (also 1600iso), which takes GREAT photos out-of-the-box, for my daughter to use in Europe this summer, hence the preference for a AA battery model.  Otherwise, I've had very reliable cameras from Canon (slr and point-n-shoot).

I Used to have the sd600 this blows it away. Great for taking pics from a moving car.The IS is worth every penny for the zoom shots!fast action too

I wouldn't consider myself an avid photographer.  In fact this camera has many bells and whistles that I will likely never use.  But as a simple point-and-shoot auto-focus camera, this one is excellent.  I had been looking for a camera with a quick shutter that would help me catch those precious moments with my kids that my other digital always seemed to miss.  This one is fantastic.  Takes beautiful crisp photos, and does so one after another so that I feel like I never miss a shot.

We got this camera for our 6 year old son for Christmas, and he loves it.  The camera is a perfect size and very light.  It has a view hole and a display which is great for him.  It has the digital zoom, but no complicated buttons on the camera- just the basics to take a picture.  It is very easy to download the pictures and email them from the directly from the software.  Great, easy to use digital camera!!!!

I am really a point and shoot guy when it comes to taking pictures so my idea of buying this  camera was its good features and plus it's a canon. I had a canon powershot S30 few years back and it was a really good camera.  I have a Sony -H1 now which is really good but it just doesn't fit into my pocket. I wanted something which can be carried around without a big bag hanging over your shoulder. I got this camera after reading thru a lot of reviews but was highly disappointed with the pictures.The best thing about this camera - its ultra portable and it looks better than most of the other competitive products. The Camera is really fast in terms of powering on and taking instant pictures. The cons and this is where it really hurts - pictures are not sharp, they look very grainy. The flash is not powerful enough if you take a lot of indoor snaps.  It has an awesome LCD display which compounds this problem. The pictures look great on the LCD screen but when you actually download it to your desktop you see a remarkable difference. I did try to play with the settings but that didn't really change much, finally had to return it back.

Replacement camera for Fuji S5200 that went for repair to New Jersey and never returned (BTW where is my camera?). This camera has a larger screen and has the ability to zoom in and out while filming. One caveat, while using my hand-me-down xD 1GB RM, I suffered data corruption. Using the current generation SD 2GB RM everything works perfect. Your results may vary  using xD. One Happy Nerd.

Great little camera to take along, the minus is-no view finder. In sunlight you cannot see the screen.

I have multiple cameras, including an Olympus Evolt 500 (SLR), and a Fuji V10.  This S700 takes great pictures and is easy to use.  I haven't tried all of the settings, but I know it works great outdoors on Auto as I took some pictures of hummingbirds that came out crisp and clear.This camera is small enough to wear on your belt, but I usually use an over the shoulder case with a strap.

JUST so you know this Canon does NOT shoot in Raw file format. I was replacing an SD40 and ASSUMED that the higher model # meant more and better features.. Oh well not the case.  ALSO the "sleek" case is very slippery. Make sure you purchase some EGrips to stick on the camera and keep it from falling out of your pocket

This camera is wonderful.  I absolutely love it.  It is easy to use and manouver, small, compact.  The only disadvantage is that there is no audio in playback, you have to hook it up to an out put device in order to hear. and another thing, it does not have an MP3 player! Bummer!  would have loved that. Otherwise, I love it.

I was very excited when I bought this camera about 4 months ago.  I bought it to carry with me in my pants pocket.  I drive around a lot and love to stop and take interesting photos around South Florida....whether they are mailboxes, churches, buildings, or any other items that catch my eye.  To say the least, its very easy to use, I've used it a lot....great quality photos can be printed either directly from the camera or my computer.  The video recorder also works easy.  One negative comment about the screen....very nice to view photos, but when taking photos in the sunlight, its very hard to see the subject. Be sure to buy a memory chip because the hard drive will fill up very fast, especially if taking HQ photos.  I bought a 512 meg after market chip which will hold about 500 HQ photos.  Another plus is the rechargeable battery and charger that come with the camera...very convenient and economical. The CD software that comes with it is kinda slow and antiquated....however the redeye removal works pretty good.  The real downside to the software is when you want to back up your photos, it puts a gun to your head and won't do it because it insists that you buy the next version.  I can't believe that Olympus did that....shame. Overall a neat little camera to have...lightweight, easy to use.

I have previously owned Fuji & Olympus, good but not exceptional. I like the ELPH because of it's small size and versatility. I have not used all of it's multiple options yet, but what I have used is exceptional. The Manuals could be made easier, but the on-line Canon website solved most problems easily. My only suggestion would be to supply the camera with a clear viewscreen protector. All of these screens don't get major scratches or damage, but skin oil and gunk do collect & it needs protection. The options are numerous, the pictures are clear, and the rechargeable battery is good. I would suggest and additional 1 GB or 2 GB card, rather than the 32MB card provided. An exceptional product.

This handy camera is good looking and produces wonderful quality pictures. Easy to handle, and navigating through the different modes is super easy. I especially love the color accent feature. I can take some professional looking pictures...and that's saying something. It's auto focus is fast and efficient for amateurs.The package however came with a mere 32 KB card which only holds 10 pictures in super quality. So I had to invest in a 2 GB card all on my cost. I'd say it was still worth it!

This is the third "S" series I have owned (had the S2 & S3). So far it's great. Facial recognition software is working as advertised. It's terrific for close up shots, but I really love the larger viewing screen.  The hot shoe is a perfect edition, because I also use a DSLR and have a Canon 580 Ex II Flash that will work on it.  On a recent trip to Southern Colorado, I discovered an important oversight.  I was shooting wildlife, but had set the image stabilizer on "continuous" instead of "Shooting".  It made a major difference.  Set it only to work when the shutter button is focused half way, so you will get better long range stability.  I agree fully with other reviews about the newly designed battery/memory card door.  It is stupid and difficult to close, and probably will break. It's a real design flaw.  I am really glad to be able to use 4 gig and higher cards now.  I use these cameras for video at times, and the larger card handles the load (FYI, video eats memory like crazy).  Also, the S5 has two extra megapixels (8) for better resolution whereas the S3 has only 6. And finally, it's a great camera to pack around when you don't want to take the higher end stuff along. All in all, I am very pleased with the upgrade but knocked it to 4 stars because of the battery door.  So, how do you move up to the next "S" model every year? Simple.  Just find a friend who needs/wants a great/new camera, and sell it to them for less than they can buy it new.  Then you can buy the new one for a few bucks more. Your friend will get a terrific camera and you will too.  It's a win-win for everybody.  Of course they will want you to help them with it, but so what.  And they will love you for helping them with it.

I got this mainly for my wife. The ease of use and large display made it perfect. I have been impressed with the quality for the price. A 2gig card will give you 1200+ photos. The Digital zoom is just OK, but overall very satisfied.

I take pictures of cars for car dealers for a living and this camera is just what we needed, something CHEAP that takes very good photos. The battery life, unlike some other statements, is great for me. I can go all day, usually around 600 shots and not have to swap out batteries. I use 2500mA batteries from Wal-Mart and have used the same set for two years now, every single day! I did manage to drop the camera pretty hard on a parking lot and the battery door flew open and batteries flew out across the lot, but when I put them back in, the camera worked fine and this was a month ago. It did damage the nice red finish, but that's not too important to me. The 2.5" LCD is a little hard to see in direct sunlight, but not nearly as bad as my old Canon Powershot camera. Indoor performance is not so great though, so if you're wanting something to do indoor portraits or lots of flash photography, you better not get this one.

The camera is good, easy to share and easy to read instructions, the only complain is... when you shoot a movie, and when you are trying to display the movie in the computer the color may not show in certain of computers.

The Fujifilm S700/S5700 is the "Best Buy" among digital cameras with a 10x zoom.It has a combination of features that no other digital camera in the "Under $200 price range can match:- a zoom that extends to about 380mm (ideal for sports photography)- the ability to manually set ISO levels- the ability to manually control both shutter speed and aperture- a choice of a large sharp "preview" screen, or a small eye level screen for use in bright sunlight- a superb "macro" lens for extreme closeups- the ability to use AA batteries, easily found at any corner store- the use of SD cards, a "first" for a Fujifilm camera- it can use both threaded filters and hoods.  I use a UV filter and a flexible rubber lens hood to both protect the lens and eliminate sources of "flare" in harsh sunlight- a shape, weight, and balance make it easy to shoot at lower than normal shutter speeds and still get sharp photos.  At 380mm, I'd normally shoot at 1/500 of a second to ensure a sharp photo.  With this camera, I can shoot at 1/125 of a second with the zoom at 380mm and get a sharp photo.What is the S700/S5700 NOT good at?  It is a mediocre camera for people who simply want to put their camera in "auto" mode, and snap away.  In the "auto" mode, the S700/S5700 often uses an ISO of ISO 400, or ISO 800 in dim light, or when high shutter speeds are required.  An 8 x 10 enlargement made at 800 ISO will lack the contrast, saturation and resolution of an 8 x 10 enlargement of a photo taken at 200 ISO or 100 ISO.To get the BEST photos from this camera, it is essential to work through the owner's manual page by page, practicing, and learning how to use each function.  After spending several afternoons doing so, I found that I got my best photos with an ISO of 100 or 200, and with a shutter speed equal to half the focal length.  So, at 380mm, I use an ISO of 200, and a shutter speed of 1/200 of a second, and, from 38mm up to 80mm, I use an ISO of 100, and a shutter speed of 1/40 of a second. An 8 x 10 enlargement of S700 photos taken at ISO 100 or ISO 200 will look as sharp as those taken with cameras selling for three or four times the price of the S700.An extraordinary attribute of this lens is the ability to get sharp results at 380mm with the lens wide open to f/5.6.  Compare the weight and price of this camera to the weight and price of a Nikon or Canon SLR lens that extends to 380mm and opens up to f/5.6, and it becomes clear what a bargain it really is.There are dozens of "owner options" detailed in the camera's manual, and the quality of photos you obtain is directly related to how much time is invested in learning and mastering each option.For folks who actually need a zoom that extends out to 380mm (for sports photography, or for bird watching) and for someone who wants to spend under $200 AND for folks who insist on having total control over all aspects of each photo, there is simply no other $200 camera that compares with the S700/S5700...EXCEPT the:- In the UK, the S5700 has been replaced by an 8 meg Fujifilm S5800.  I'm guessing that the Fujifilm S700 will be replaced by a Fujifilm "S800" here in the USA in November 2007, just in time for the holiday season.  Just one extra meg of resolution may not matter for snapshots, but for a heavily cropped 8 x 10 enlargement, it might add a tiny bit of extra detail.

I am very satisfied with the camera. Very light and cute, easy to carry. More importantly, all the functions it promised worked out very well and very user friendly designed (don't need to read the manual at all).Battery last quite long just as promised. The only con is there are only 2 options available for picture resolution. It would be perfect, if there are more options, i.e. some lower options in case you want to record something but didn't want to do it too big in size. However, you can always resize it through some PC programs. Overall, as a non-professional camera, it works very well for me.

My wife and I love this camera however the first one we got and the replacement both have the same issue of the lens getting stuck when you turn it on.  This seems to happen about 20% of the time.  The only way to make it work is to push the lens corner so that it comes unstuck.  Then it is fine until the next time it gets stuck.Everything else about the camera is great.  Fast pics, easy to use, good quality, lightweight, etc.

A good point-and-shoot camera.  My only complaints are that if you use the zoom AT ALL (even in bright daylight outside), the pictures are not crisp.  You really have to be less than 6 feet from the subject and do not use the zoom feature if you are further away than that.  Also, the flash is very weak and indoor pictures are not good quality (again, unless you are right up close to the subject).

I got this camera a few days ago and have been taking pictures of everything! This camera isn't packed with a lot of features, but the options it does offer are very nice. This camera is so easy to use, and you don't have to go through a million menus to get what you want. You can change the colors (from normal) to black and white, sepia, vivid, or custom color (lets you change the contrast, sharpness, ect.). You can also specify what kind of lighting you are in and it adjusts colors accordingly so the picture doesn't look strange. My favorite though is the Macro setting. This feature lets you take really close up pictures, and they look gorgeous! I've taken numerous pictures of beautiful flowers in my yard, and the pictures turn out even better than I thought they would. Also, when I hold this camera, it doesn't feel like it will slip out of my hand. It's small, but not too small. And not too slim either. Many of my pictures would have turned out much more blurry if I felt like I couldn't really hold onto the camera. Finally, it's very very easy to upload pictures using the software and cord they give you. The software installs quick and easy, and with one click you can have all your pictures you've taken. I would recommend this camera to just about anyone, especially people who are beginners in photography or who just want to take great pictures on a vacation.

I bought this Sony product as it synchronises with my Sony Ericsson mobile phone. The memory card is compatible for both. The 7.2 MP was also very appealing. The convenience of having one common card played out positively with use. However, the clarity I was looking for did not materialise with the 7.2 MP claim. a previous Sony camera with a 4-5 MP specification was not bad compared with this one. It is possible that there is a plateau in the graph of clarity and MP until it rises again. The technical department of Sony can better explain this matter.

I replaced a Powershot sd100 with the SD1000.  I wanted the view window for taking photos in the sun. I am glad I got it.  In the sun it is still hard to view the screen.  This camera is great.  Time between shots is fast enough for me.  I like the way it focuses on more than one face. For the money it's a great guy.

This is a great basic digital camera.  My only comments are that I find the zoom feature somewhat inconvenient.  I take a lot of distance pictures, and if enough time passes in between shots, the camera will revert to the "normal" view and you will have to zoom in all over again.

i bought this sd1000 after much research.  i was trying to decide between it and the canon sd750.  the difference seems to be the lcd screen size: sd1000 has 2.5 inch and sd750 3 inch.  i like the idea of the 3 inch but really the 2.5 is just fine and i;m not sad that it isn't 3 inches.  the second difference is the optional viewfinder: sd1000 has a viewfinder and the sd750 does not have one.  i have yet to use the viewfinder on the sd1000 but maybe someday i will be thankful for it.  price sometimes is the only other factor with the sd1000 being cheaper and the sd750 a little more money.  i finally decided on the sd1000 because i found a good price with amazon and the viewfinder too even though i really wanted the 3 inch lcd.  i am so so happy with the camera.  it takes excellent pictures and i have good results with video too!  the only tricky pictures i've had to take is with no flash in darker enviornments like a concert.  the lighting is random so the camera would have a hard time focusing.  with no flash i turned up the iso and it did fine but of course the pictures were more grainy.  but for the price and for buying a point and shoot, it does wonderfully!  it does exactly what a point and shoot should do!

Very reasonable price for such a great camera.  The various features, and types of shots are fantastic.  The 10x optical zoom is not bad, but I felt it could be better.  Quality is excellent with the 7.1 megapixels, but each picture takes up a lot of space/memory with over 1mb per shot.  If you like quality this is a great camera, if you rather conserve space/memory you might want to shop around, however there are settings on the camera where you can lower the resolution. Video setting on the camera is ok too, very clear but again takes up a great amount of memory on your card.

Sony Cybershot was my first digital camera purchase.  I'm a complete novice and find this camera very easy to use.  Wonderful pics that I upload to my pc and send to my local store to print on their laser printer.  The software that came with it is very easy as well for editing and turning into close-ups.  Only bad thing is I didn't get a case for it right away and let it rub against my cell phone in my bag and sort of scratched up the LED screen - but it's completely unnoticable when shooting.  However, I recommend some sort of case for it...

I will not be very technical with my review as many others have appropriately described this camera in detail already.  I am a busy working parent who simply loves photography.  I wanted something easy and small enough to fit in my purse or jacket pocket on the run.  I bought this to replace a sadly outdated Olympus D560 which was so slow my kids would be on the bus and down the street before the shutter even went off on the first day of school - I missed many precious moments because of it.  I then discovered this camera after much much research.  What a find!  It's fast and has virtually no hesitation, lots of features and settings, and the pictures are fabulous.  Natural light photography was non-existent in my old Olympus, but sharp and appropriately lit with this Canon.  Love the macro feature - my close ups of flowers and bugs look like they came out of National Geographic! Whether I'm taking pictures of a Red Sox game at Fenway Park or my son's Little League games, my action pictures are great.  I am able to freeze the action with no blur and capture the image as it happens without missing it due to delay in the shutter.  I would buy this camera all over again!

This is a beautiful little camera to own and look at, seems very well made, hefts easily and works easily, menus are quite comprehensive, require a bit of reading, and awful lot there, or if you get lazy, go to full automatic.And now for what it produces, first, I use Picas 2 from Google, I like it, does what I want it to do.When you look at the photos on the screen, they are well, sort of BLAH, well I edit with Picasa 2 and print, they come print out very, very well, color is nice, and photos are sharp, very pleasing qualities everyone I,ve show the shots too really liked them, image stabilization works well, what we sets it apart from so many other digital cams in this size and price range, its 7.2 megs, and just like Olympus says, you can very well take shots in an almost totally dark room, also seems to work very well in bright light, with all of these compact cameras I think Olympus has engineereed the best screen, its a lovely little camera that I hope to have for some time. The battery is small, but, seems to last for quite a while.I thoroughly enjoy using it and the results it gives.

The optics are great. The focus lock is solid and evident. The camera is ready for use 1/2 second after you hit the power switch. At 10X zoom with a tripod, it will resolve many of the larger craters on the moon, althoughthe moon is only about 500 pixels in diameter at full optical zoom. It's great for wildlife. I have a picture of a swan with three cygnets taken about 100 ft. from the nest that is excellent. I like the quick review button, as well as the fact that the camera returns to shooting mode as soon as the shutter button is pressed. The auto mode is fine for general purpose point and shoot, but the anti-shake mode is a decided plus at the larger zoom settings.The menus are intuitive and all controls are conveniently placed.I've taken about 1000 pictures over two vacations plus done a lot of experimenting.The only lost pictures have been about three or four due to not waiting for a focus lock on the correct target zone, and about the same number when there was an un-noticed strongly reflecting peripheral object in the foreground in flash mode. Even though Auto works well, I like having the ability to control settings, particularly in available light situations. Shutter priority and flash off with auto ISO are good choices. The pictures tend to be grainy at ISO 800 and 1600 but even this beats losing a shot.Another plus is the dual memory card slot, since I have other cameras which use SD cards as well.I had no trouble transferring pictures from the camera to the computer with either memory.I've used 2500 maH Nickel-Metal-Hydride Rechargeables, and about 400 shotsper charge seems to be a good number.I would imagine from past experiencethat disposables would be good for about 100 shots.I have been really pleased with every aspect of the performance. It'ssimple enough for a beginner in the auto mode, and has enough control to satisfy any more advanced amateur.

The flash on this camera doesn't go off when it should and even when it does the pictures are dark and blurry. I have a kodak camera with 4MP that is three years old and it takes far better pictures. Don't buy this camera. If you want a kodak upgrade to a better model. This camera is not worth even the cheap price.

Although my "big" camera is a Canon, I went through several cameras before finding this wonderful gem. I was very fond of my seriously outdated Nikon Coolpix, so I tried a new one - every shot was blurry, and I have a very steady hand (years of taking low-light and no-flash shots). I moved on to a Panasonic due to the many features, including awesome 6x zoom and a very handy "backlight" option. But the noise, even on as little as ISO 200, was unacceptable. Took a shot at the GE850 with even more features, but found a harsh flash and odd color.Exasperated with the point-and-shoot market, I finally returned to Canon and decided on the 560. I couldn't be happier! It may not have the highest optical zoom, or the most formats (it makes up for the lack of 3:2 with an overlay that allows you to compose a shot within a 3:2 grid, excellent!), or the most modes (although several of the modes on other brands are so specialized - silly even - that they are worthless). But it has what counts - the most-used settings up front on the dial, excellent color representation, the least flash-fallout of any I tried, and exceptional quality even without image stabilization. And unlike the GE, the face recognition works on pets :) This camera does have a Manual setting that allows customized white balance, metering, color options, and exposure compensation.I will not be trading this one in!

It took me 6 months of waiting and waiting and finally I took the plunge and bought this camera.  I did the research and compared other cameras, (lumix and sony) and decided on canon's good name and track record.  I wasn't disappointed and was thoroughly happy with my decision.  Took 130 plus pics on my vacation to Pebble Beach and not one bad picture!  There was only blurry picture because my batteries were dying.  I can't wait to use it for my kids school performances to see how the zoom performs from the middle of the auditorium.  This is the main reason I bought it;so that I wouldn't look like a crazed mom taking pictures of my kid at her concerts!

This camera is great.  It's small, takes excellent/sharp photos, ergonomic, looks cool.  And OH that large, bright and crisp 3inch LDC is the way to go.  I will never miss a view finder.  IS would be good, but if you stick with Canon (and I do) you have to go with the bigger, thicker sd700, sd800, sd900 etc.  It's not worth it to me.If you're in the market, don't walk, RUN and buy this camera.  Better yet, just order from Amazon as they have a great price.  You can also get an extra battery for $13 from Amazon.  It's not Canon but mine works great!  I can't say enough good things about this camera.

We bought this great little camera to keep in our pocket during a vacation.  It is quick on the draw and takes great pictures, which are really important for this class of camera.  It is fun, easy to use, and gives great results.After getting used to the camera, there are a few minor quibbles I have.  For one thing there is no battery meter, which was unexpected.  That is about the only real complaint I have.  It does not have AP or SP priority modes, which I have wanted a few times.  I knew this up front, and still happily chose the camera, so I can only fault myself for that.  The time lapse mode does not allow for a custom or arbitrary interval, but it is still fun.  I always wish a camera had manual focus.  But all these things do not detract from the 5 star rating, they are just a wish list for the next revision.Basically, there were a few times when I wished I had more than a pocket camera in my pocket.  But for a pocket camera this thing is great.

Several of the flaws metioned in other reviews are very true: 1) the screen hardly works in sunlight, and there's not much you can do about it. 2) there is no optical viewfinder to use when this is the case.  3) the battery is small and lasts about 50 shots, less if you use flash.  The camera also has a number of nice plusses: 1) 7.1 MP means great image quality, 2) image stabilization prevents those blurry indoor shots, 3) 5 x optical zoom, not usually seen in a camera this small, 4) lots of gee whiz features (my fave is the panorama mode, which knits pictures together side to side or top to bottom), 5) form factor that's sleek, compact, small, and nice-looking (especially in black), and certainly not least: it's very cheap thanks to the discount here.  $170 for a camera of this quality is amazing, and if you're willing to accept the flaws above it's a nice choice for a great price.  I'm very happy with mine.One reviewer is way off the mark: this camera DOES have a "delete all" function, and can dump all the photos off the card with three quick clicks.  I'd be happy to explain how.

What a step up from my 4.1 Sony digital camera.  The photos taken with this camera are so sharp.  I haven't even explored all the possibilities this camera offers yet.  The portrait photos I have taken of my new grandson are beautiful.  I have also enjoyed taking some video clips.  I'm more than happy with this purchase.

I was skeptical when buying the Fuji S700 after reading varying reviews on amazon and cnet. However, I was pleasantly surprised by its performance. I like to take photos, and am competent when it comes to zooming and changing basic settings (nothing too technical!). This camera has many different shooting modes, including beach, fireworks, portrait, etc. with a turn of the wheel on top, it produces just the right tones in the picture. Outdoor/nature pictures are simply amazing. There are alternate settings which let advanced users make specific changes (ISO, Aperture), but I don't use those at all. That's what's so great about this camera--advanced users can change settings to their liking, while beginners like me can just let the camera decide on the best setting with 'auto' mode. The zoom is better than any other camera i've ever tried. Cameras these days usually only have 3x optical zoom. What is the point of buying some 10 megapixel camera if the zoom is totally inefficient? The S700 boasts 10x optical zoom, which comes in useful when taking pictures at the beach or at baseball games. No other camera in the market has this much zoom for this price. The 10x zoom pictures look like you're just a few feet away. The image stabilization feature is also great! There's too many good things to say about this camera. Anyway, if you're looking for a camera that produces clear prints, has user-friendly setting modes, and can zoom very far while maintaing picture quality--this is it.

I purchased this for my daughter, but was not very impressed with it.  It was very elementary.  Although it is very easy to use, I had hoped it had a little more extras.  biggest dissapointment was not sound with the video.  I have since given it to my niece and purchased another for my daughter, with upgrades.

Having had another Nikon digital camera for the past few years I knew I liked the operation and durability of their products.  When it came time to get multiple units for work I went with the L11 unit.  It is small, light, has a large view screen and lense protector, and it runs well on regular AA batteries.  My employees have had them for two months now and they are working great so far. For the price this camera is a real deal!

There was some delay in the shipping of this item, but Amazon kept us informed at all times. The camera is easy to use, just like the Canon PowerShot A70, which we have had for several years. We bought this camera because my husband liked the larger display and because we have been having some trouble with the display of the other older Canon.So far the camera has been great!

I recently bought this camera as a gift for my daughter. The camera is incredible. Pictures are just great. Colors are just about right, and the pictures are very sharp, with minimum noise and with the correct exposure. Macro is also good. She is beginning to use the camera this last week, and she is very pleased with it. I recommended this camera to some friends also. You won't have anything better for the money.

This is a nice camera with a super display.  I've had this for just a few weeks and have already used many of its features like different shot modes and time-lapse movie mode.  The battery lasted a whole day at Sea World.  So far, the only downside is the night shots in both auto shot mode and night mode; but I suspect that is true with most digital cameras.  I can't give it a 5 because it's not perfect, but it is a solid 4.

I purchased this camera in April and I am very pleased with the quality of the pictures I have taken so far. The only problem I have encountered has been the fact that the SD memory card cannot be used for pictures that you would want to transfer to a PC. The only card that can be transferred is the mDX memory card. So if you buy this camera, be sure to get the mDX memory card if you want to download the pictures on a PC. Otherwise it is great!!!!!

I have an older 2 MP Kodak Easy Share.  That one had a good, sturdy feel to it.  This model, although with 5 MP, is for me too lightweight.  It feels like plastic.  I didn't like that the lens is covered over with glass which can scratch rather than a retractable lens cap (as the older camera had), so I have to provide extra protection so the glass won't get scratched.  I tried out this C530 over Christmas Eve and I was quite disappointed that most of my photos had white orbs here and there on the photos.  I tried the video feature in normal to low indoor lighting and the images couldn't be discerned.  This camera is listed as a 5 MP which is supposed to make a least a nice, clear 8" x 10" but I have my concerns after seeing the quality of the photos that I got, that this camera is putting out that expected quality.  Overall....I'm disappointed.

Overall, the camera is packed with features and seems to be taking good pictures.  I have found a bluish halo around white-framed shots that I need to investigate.  The big fault I have with the camera is that it feels cheap and plastic!  My last digital camera was a Casio Slim Shot (?) that was metal and withstood wear and tear.  The Sony Cybershot is fragile, light and seemingly made of plastic which makes me wonder about the quality of the "carl zeiss" lens and whether it will be able to withstand living in my backpack or jacket pocket, ready for use.I dont think I would recommend this camera to everyday users and would definitely have shopped around with cameras in person before purchasing.

I have just purchased this camera for easier travel use.  My main camera is a Nikon D70s but it is too big to travel easily.  The Canon SD750 is a very compact camera.  The camera does not come with a carrying case so I purchased the leather case which I think is a necessary addition.  Video is somewhat grainy full screen except in the 640 mode (30 fps) which seems to be quite good and very watchable on a 20 inch computer monitor full screen.  Still picture quality is excellent.  Side by side pictures with my Nikon show comperable quality which is quite amazing for such a small package.  The camera is easy to use.  I purchased the 2 Gb Extreme card which I think is perfect for my use, especially with video.  The 2 Gb card appears to give me about 15 minutes of video at the 640 resolution.  All in all the camera has exceeded my expectations.

The camera is great - however the lens cap is flimsy and comes off easily.It took me about a ½ of reading to figure out how to put the camera on black and white and how to manually focus.  But once I figured it out it works great.

This is a great little camera, light and convenient to carry around. The pic quality is great if it's not blurred. It does not have an anti-shake feature (or image stabilizer) so you have to hold it very still to take a decent pic; which make it hard to rely on other people to take good pic of you!! and also you usually have to take a few shots of the same spot to get a good one.2 other features that are lacking: it is great with outdoor shooting but  bad with indoors. The movie mode only have sound when you play back on the tv or pc. The old camera I had allowed playback with sound on the camera itself; which was great as it allows me to hear what I recorded.Everything else is great.

relatively easy to use UI, great long exposure facility (up to 15 seconds,) compact size.  Image quality is very good at the high resolution, (3Kx2K) shoots reasonable 640x480 video.  with a 4GB add on sd memory card, the capacity is enormous, (over 1200 of the largest size image.) shoots very quickly, very little wait between shots. only down side is proprietary battery, it does come with an external charger, so having a spare is not difficult.  full charge takes around 90 minutes.

I bought this camera to keep in the truck because I always seem to forget to take one with me. This is a nice small camera with many good fetures.It takes really good pictures any price.  It can use rechargeable batteries and they have never needed recharging during a picture taking use. See all my reviews

I wanted a camera that I could wear on my belt or put in my pocket.It takes great pictures outdoors - at least when I use it. Indoors you can guarantee red eye from all subjects - supposedly the closer the lens is to the flash the more red-eye you get. So when the vampires are photoshopped out of your life you can enjoy this midget's clarity and convenience.Any programming problems are easily solved by a young child but may elude an adult.

My company owns this camera to use at work to take complimentary pictures for our customers.  I chose this camera/printer dock to buy for my daughter's 15th birthday, it is perfect for her 1st digital camera.  Easy to use and print.  Personally, I am a photo "nut" and I own a much more expensive complex camera, so it's not for me.  But she's going to love it, and it didn't cost an arm and a leg.....I love the fact that everything she needs comes together so I didn't have to buy everything seperately.  Highly recommended for a first timer or one who doesn't want all the technical stuff!!

I recommend this camera to all of my friends who are shopping for a new digi. For the price, you really cannot find a better deal.

Camera worked absolutly wonderful until the batteries that it came with ran out.  Since then I have purchased various other AA brands with the same results.  Rechargable, top of the line, kodak brand it doesn't matter.  Camera shuts off after about 2 minutes of use each time.  I then have to take out the batteries and reinsert to get another 2 minutes.  The kodak brand was the only brand of batteries I could get to do even this.  sorta of a ripoff because by the time I discovered this problem I had already thrown away the packaging and receipt, so return is not an option.  After a bit of research I have also confirmed that this is a pretty common problem.  This is the sort of camera that people with tight budgets are going to buy when they want something a little nicer.  So I wanted to inform people that they may not get what they paid their hard earned money for.  Think seriously and perhaps buy another brand.  Good luck.

I love this compact shirt pocket snap shooter and I am convinced that the Canon SD1000 gives you one of the biggest bangs for your buck available.Unfortuantely there is a lot to learn about all that is built into the SD1000 and the manuals are a pain to read. Here is a summary I found on one photo site of just the SD1000's operation. RTFM to learn all the details but this summary helps a lot. BTW I have found great 2GB SD cards work in this camera for less than $18.--Canon PowerShot SD1000 OperationOperating the SD1000 in Auto mode is straightforward and simple, albeit with limited access to some of the camera's controls. Manual mode offers more options and is relatively intuitive and, with the user guide in hand, easy to master. Most controls are no more than a button push away via the 4-way controller (ISO, Flash, Single/Continuous Shooting and Self-Timer, and Macro/Normal/Infinity), a Function Menu (Shooting Mode, Exposure Compensation, White Balance, My Colors, Metering, JPEG compression, and Resolution) or the full system menu, with set-up options and settings that generally do not have to be changed very often. There are a few exceptions, however, including the need to activate Face Detection or AiAF, red-eye reduction and slow synchro flash settings and Grid Overlay via the system menu. Although there are no dedicated control buttons per se, the Print/Share button can be programmed for one of a number of controls for direct access. Canon SD1000 Modes and MenusAuto Record Mode: In this mode, the camera automatically selects the settings for image capture, although compression and image size options are available in the Function menu. Limited options are also available for ISO, Flash, Self-Timer and Macro. Manual Mode: Since the camera lacks manual aperture and shutter speed controls, the SD1000's "Manual" mode provides access to various settings and features like Exposure Compensation, White Balance, ISO and other options via the Function menu and 4-way controller. Scene Mode: A variety of scene modes are available in the Function menu, including Digital Macro, Portrait, Night Snapshot, Kids & Pets, Indoor, Foliage, Snow, Beach, Fireworks, Aquarium, and Underwater.Movie Mode: Accessed via the mode switch, this mode records movies with sound. Movie options include Standard (640 x 480 or 320 x 240; both resolutions can be recorded at either 30 frames per second or 15fps), with a 4GB size maximum, although the camera will stop recording after 1 hour of continuous shooting regardless of whether or not the SD card has been filled. Fast Frame Rate, which is limited to a 1 minute clip, is designed to photograph action such as a sporting event. The Compact mode records a clip of up to 3 minutes and is small enough to be e-mailed. Color Accent and Color Swap modes, which allow you to shoot in black and white maintaining one color as an accent or you can change (swap) one color for another. Recording pixels and frame rate (640 x 480 or 320 x 240 at 30fps or 15fps) are selectable and movies can be recorded up to 4GB, although recording will stop after 1 hour of continuous shooting even if the 4GB maximum as not been reached. In Time Lapse mode, the camera can be set to capture an image every 1 or 2 seconds for up to 2 hours. When played back, the final "movie" will be compressed to 4 or 8 minutes, depending on the interval set (2 second intervals will net a 4 minute movie after two hours; 1 second intervals will net an 8 minute movie after two hours). Although sound recording is not available in this mode, you can create interesting clips such as tracking the progress of a house being built, a dinner being prepared (and consumed) or plants blooming. Note: Standard and Color Accent/Color Swap modes require a high speed and high capacity SD card to reach maximum recording time.Playback Mode: Also accessed via the mode switch, playback allows you to review images for content and quality, arrange them into categories, mark them for printing and deletion. Movies can also be viewed an edited in this mode. .Record Menu System: This menu is displayed when the Menu button is pressed. Available options may change according to shooting mode but are arranged according to three tabs: Record, Setup and My Camera. Ai/AF: Sets the camera's 9-point AiAF focus system on and off. Can also be used to select automatic Face Detection, which detects subjects' faces, focuses and adjusts exposure/flash intensity according to the scene. When AiAF or Face Detection are not selected, the camera sets the focus point at the center of the frame.Digital Zoom: Turns the camera's 4x digital zoom on and off. When on, the digital zoom engages after the optical zoom has reached the maximum telephoto focal length. The digital zoom can also be set to a fixed 1.5x or 1.9x zoom. The digital zoom can also be utilized for the Standard movie mode. Slow Synchro: Sets the flash synchro option on and off. When on, shutter stays open longer (slower shutter speed) to record more ambient light so the areas not reached by the flash are more visible and better exposed. Red-Eye: Sets the flash red-eye reduction on and off. Self-Timer: Sets the Self-Timer delay from 0-10 seconds, or 15, 20, or 30 seconds. Sets the number of consecutive shots taken from 1-10; the default setting is 3 shots. Auto ISO Shift: Turns the Auto ISO Shift on and off. When on, depress the shutter button halfway and press the Print/Share Button to automatically boost the ISO to an appropriate setting up to ISO 800.

When on, a small lamp on the front of the camera illuminates to assist in low light focusing. Review: Turns instant review on and off. Sets the number of seconds, from 1-10 an image is displayed on the LCD immediately after capture. A Hold option displays the image until the shutter button is pressed halfway. Save Original: Available only when Color Swap or Color Accent modes are selected. When on, you have the option of saving the original image as well as the image that has been altered. Auto Category: On/Off options sets whether or not images are automatically assigned to categories during shooting, i.e., people, scenery, events.

They convinced me along with Steve's Digi Cams and the valuable input from all those posting user reviews to Amazon to try the SD1000. Hundreds of people clearly have already discovered the new Canon SD1000 and I am somewhat late having suffered through an expensive waste of time and money with other digital cameras that don't come close to the quality and ease of use of the SD1000.Ki4je

I became the proud owner of an Olympus Stylus 710 and I absolutely loved that little camera.  Someone had an accident with my camera and I had to replace it.  I did research and I found this 750 and I loved the fact that it s a 5x Optical zoom.  i figured that being an upgraded product that it would be a better camera.I went to Vegas with the camara and it worked beautifully outdoors.  The colors were crisp and clear, but night photography was awful.  If I used the flash the pictures were to dark, used the night scene even with a tripod and pics were blurry, used the outdoor available light feature pictures came out but were on the yellow side.  Made all the necessary adjustments and would switch back and forth on features and would even take several pictures of the same item looking for that "good" picture. Shooting into backligght was an issue. None of these were issues I had with my 710.  Unfortunately, I did return the 750 and was able to replace my 710, which I am absolutely happy with.

I have owned a lot of the canon cameras, all have been great buys. last one was the 450, which was a nice camera, but this is an amazing upgrade, all the features the 450 needed, much better double zoom, color saturation is great, still some trouble with low light, but the auto focus really snaps the picture tighter and cleaner. this camera is bringing all the fun back in to shooting , pets and outdoors, great buy with the one gig card, I have a video camera, so never use that feature.thanks amazon for amazing shipping once again!

It's sleek and easy to use.  There are a lot of features on it that I am still playing around with, but it is simple to use and gives good quality when the photos are printed.  It was also fairly inexpensive compared to others with the same megapixals.

After my daughter purchased this very camera, but in Pink, my wife issisted she get one. At 7.1mp, the quality of the pictures is more than enough. Once she read through the short and easy to understand manual, my wife became a pro at taking great pictures. She usually does not like anything fancy, but rather she prefers easy to use electronics. She loves her new little Sony and enjoys more how easy it is to operate.

After reading some of the reviews here I expected "average indoor" pictures. I bought this camera because I wanted a smaller one I can carry around easier.  I took some pictures at a halloween party last night that was in a bar, so the lighting was terrible.  All of the pics turned out fantastic!  Not one red eye, no grain, no wierd color, just perfect crystal clear pictures.  At first the pictures were grainy & blury, then I realized the camera was set to "manual".  When I switched it to "auto" I got perfect pictures.  I also bought the 2 gig card with it.  Recording videos is so easy and fun.  This camera has alot of features for it's price, I am very impressed.

Very versatile camera  with many optional functions that are easy to access.  Shot to shot speed is excellent even in flash conditions.  Rapid start-up.  The flip out LCD screens allows shots to be taken from many different angles, which makes for intersting shots and allows the user to take pictures from previously inaccesible positions.  Review of pictures, downloading, and in camera editing expands this products value.  I find the movie button valuable for quick video takes when a picture just simply won't do.  While in movie mode you can still depress the shutter and take still pictures, once again added value.  I would advise with the purchase of this camera one would also want at least a 4GB high speed SD card.  Video takes quite a bit of memory and this camera will allow a maximum or 4GB or 1 hour of recording whichever comes first.  The settings I have videoed on would take a full 4GB to get slightly less than 1 hour of recording.  One complaint that I do have and this is probably operator error, but it seems that with headshots the camera has trouble focusing on the face which produces a blurry shot.  Still use this camera for a day and you will find yourself fully satisfied unless you really wanted an SLR.

PROS:  great price, high resolution, 10x zoom, easy to use, variety of options, good feelCONS;  no significant negatives discovered yet (it is not a pocket camera, but I didn't want a pocket camera)Several years ago, I researched digital cameras & settled on an earlier version Finepix - that camera worked very well until it suddenly died.  Looking for a replacement, I was pleased to see this one under $200.  Unlike many cheap digital cameras, it has great 10x zoom and a good "feel" to it.  Aside from being much cheaper than its predecesors, the camera is surprisingly light for its size.  The best of both worlds - easy to operate, yet with advanced features should you care to use them.   So your grandmom or young child can "point & shoot," or you can experiment with different speeds, zoom, use the timer, whatever.  The controls are very easy to find & decipher - the only draw back being that scrolling through the menu options, it is easy to leave the menu & need to go through screens to re-enter.  I especially liked the option of seeing the last three shots in smaller windows on the display while devoting the bulk of the screen to the current shot.  Another nice feature is the ability to switch from screen to viewfinder - many digitals don't give the option of viewfinder for some reason.

I really like this camera. I use it for photos that I take for my Romantic Oregon Coast Vacations web site [...]It is very easy to use. I also got the dock for it with the rechargable battery pack. This ensures that I'm always ready to go. The photos are nice and clear. Since I got it recently, there are some features that I haven't tried yet, but know that I will use down the road. Just right for a casual photographer. A big thumbs up!

Approximately 30 days after purchasing my SD 1000 from Amazon the sensor went dead.  Amazon took the return and sent me a new one.  Forty five days later the camera started hesitating in opening when the power was turned on.  A few days later, the camera simply would not operate.  Two dead cameras within two months.  I've had half a dozen digital cameras, not one has broken previously, let alone twice in two months.  The camera is back at Canon for repair.  The camera replace on old Minolta Dimage that I always carried with me, treated with disdain and it always worked with high quality images.  I've given it to my teenage son who treats it worse.  The camera keeps on ticking - I'm sorry the brand is still not available.During the few weeks the camera worked, I liked its size, operation and quality of its pictures.

This camera is very nice. I actually bought it for my g/f and she loves it. When it first arrrived I got to mess w/ it a bit before giving it up to her. I really enjoyed the different settings to take the picutres. Its great cause usually you get those shots that are way too bright because of the flash or too dark because of no flash. This camera takes care of both problems  easy. I even enjoyed the software it came w/. The only problem I had was when you upload the pictures to the computer be sure you push the "safely remove hardware" button or you will end up getting the camera to say there is more pictures  on the camera than there are. This was easy to solve though. Theres a way you can clear the camera memory but Im not sure I remember how. So that problem was more user error than product problems. Great camera and a great price. It might not be the same prices since I got it from the electronics expo so it was knocked down in price but it has to be worth the original price. So theres my review. Not in depth but to the point. Good enough.

I love this camera. It is perfect for someone who likes photography but does not have professional pretenses. It is easy to use, feature packed and has excellent picture quality. The 12x zoom and image stabilization work perfectly, and the video and sound functions are incredible for a photo camera; there really is no need to own a separate video camera anymore for people like me who mostly like to shoot stills. It's a little bigger and heavier than the real compacts, but it has that nice sturdy Canon feel and all the qualities mentioned above make it well worth carrying around the extra weight.

I recently purchased this item and love it.  I'm not one for reading the user manual and figured it out fairly quickly.  My teenagers also.  My husband hates camera's, but actually uses this one.I've down loaded on my Mac with no effort.  The pictures are clean, very detailed and the the speed of the camera is awsome.  I was looking for a fairly inexpensive camera to take pictures just in general/kids/family.  I've pruchased 2 easy shot kodak camera's in the past and found them to be slow and a waste of money with so-so pictures.I would recommend this camera for anyone who is sick of the so-so camera's they've had and take a step-up without paying a boat load!

I dont know why people complain about this camera? It has exceeded a lot of cameras ive had. It works better than nikon coolpix L11 and is cheaper. The video audio is crisp clear, awesome clips ive made. Its very user friendly. All cameras use up batteries, but this by far is the longest lasting compared to Kodak C series. Always get rechargeables.

This is the 2nd Canon model A camera I've had, and it seems they are still a good value. The image stabilization feature works really well - definitely has improved the quality of my pictures in almost all lighting conditions. My only personal complaint is that the camera is much lighter than I'm used to, so that makes it feel a little delicate; however, I haven't had any actual problems with it at all. A lot of people might like a lighter camera anyway because that does make it easier to carry in a pocket - definitely possible with this camera. Bottom line: a great value, and I'm very happy with my purchase.

Two months ago, I bought the Stylus 750 to replace an aging Kodak digital. Unlike the Kodak, the Olympus has no "delete all phots" feature, so the only way to delete all the photos from the camera after transfering to the computer is to look at each photo separately on the camera's LCD display, push the delete button on the back of the camera, confirm that I really want to delete it, then it's gone. One photo gone and 235 to go. It takes about 10 minutes to delete every hundred photos (each deletion requires 3 button pushes, one picture at a time). I've now bought a replacement camera (a Canon) that has a "delete all photos" option. I never would have guessed that a camera would be sold that made it so hard to delete the photos. It's a flaw that makes the camera functionally so clunky that I'd advise looking to another manufacturer for your digital camera purchase.

The bad is the batteries expire quickly once the camera is connected to the computer. It's difficult to open the filmsy door to insert the batteries. Another bad is it's hard to see the item in the camera's display in the sun, too much reflection. The good is the pictures come out good. The camera is easy to use. I'm the type that hits buttons to see what they do. I haven't destroyed any thing yet. The software that comes with the camera is ok. Another product is needed to really edit a photo. Over all it's a good camera for a beginner and the money.

Poor product suport and no solution to an issue that Olympus clearly acknowledges. Difficult to impossible to use in bright light conditions, indoors or outdoors. Screen is too reflective. Olympus offers nothing and suggests purchasing Play Station screen protectors stating that it  helps. I did.  No significant improvement, especially outdoors. Poor product support. No solution to problem. A view finder would resolve the issue on future products. For now, I am stuck with a product that I cannot use. For a great deal, check Craig's list.

I bought this camera after reading several satisfactory reviews. It could be because I am not a professional photographer, but the pictures it took were mediocre at best. I wasn't expecting top quality since the camera only cost $249, but I expected a portable camera that I could take on the go.  I had it for 6 months and used it about 7 times when it unexpectedly stopped working. I was not too concerned as the camera had a one year warranty and followed the instructions of sending the camera in for repair.  Three weeks pass and I hear nothing, so I check the status on line to find that it is awaiting repair and the cost is $153.  I called to check why there was a cost associated with a camera that is under warranty, and was informed that the warranty was void due to "damage by impact".  I assured the representative that the camera had never been dropped, and that is when she told me that impact could be from being placed in a purse. It seems a camera should be more durable than breaking from being placed in a bag.

After using this camera for several months, I threw it out after it broke for the last time I wanted to deal with it.  I thought this would be a decent camera due to the easy-to-use features and the pictures taken being adequate for the price.  The computer interface was not as user-friendly as other digital cameras I've had or seen, but the battery consumption was a bigger problem.  Taking about 15-20 pictures was average for me before having to reload another set of batteries.  That can become expensive.  Worse is finding the lens "freezes" when the batteries are low and one changes them.  The lens on mine refused to open after the last battery change.  After finding out this was a common problem, I got a more dependable camera.

I purchased this camera about a year ago for my home structural inspection work.  The first time I took it out I had the camera in my pocket doing my normal stuff.  When I pulled it out, the LCD screen was broken.  The Samsung guys fixed it under warranty with no problems.  I will give them one star for that.  Since getting it back from repair, I have had this camera pretty much stored in my camera bag, using it once for a family get-together.  I did not need to otherwise use it because I got a Kodak EasyShare C653 to use  when I sent the Samsung off for repair.  The Kodak I have literally put through hell using it in dusty, muddy, spiderweb-infested crawlspaces.  It lasted about 9 months with this abuse but died.  When I pulled the Samsung out to used it, it failed the first time I pushed the Power button.So, I encourage anyone reading this review to NOT purchase this camera.  Although the price is cheap, the camera is junk, unless you want to pay that amount for a paperweight.

I got this camera very quickly, service was fantastic. I say this because any retailer who sells these shouldnt feel too responsible for the sin that is this camera. I have had my dealings with 3.2mp cameras, some made in the 1990s and I am very appalled to have used this camera and to get this kind of low quality shot. Pictures are blurry. Well unless you use the flash, then they are completely "pixelated" and are engulfed in white.This is not a deal for the money, it doesnt even serve its purpose as a camera.I will say I love the design of the camera, and this just makes me want apple to delve into the camera industry. Conclusion: dont purchase this if you're looking for something to take pictures with. If you want to load this on your computer and waste your time, go for it, otherwise, buy anything else.

The reviews for this camera were great, but after a few rounds of photos, I found the Sony Cybershot DSCW55 very disapointing.  The majority of the photos from this camera come out blurry.  Only about 1 in 8 photos are crisp and of a quality similar to that of my old HP 707.  Also, the camera changes modes with very little effort, so that when you pull it out of the case it may very well have gone from auto to ISO or even video, and you have missed the shot.

I purchased this camera KNOWING that I was buying an inexpensive digital camera that I could use for fun pictures.  I didnt think I would be winning any awards with the photos I took with it (I have a $300 Canon Rebel EOS for that).  So far I have had some struggles (mostly with the flash) but I have to say overall Ive been pleased with the results.  Once you figure out that natural lighting works best, you can get good inside pictures.  I took several beautiful pictures of the Rocky mountains from an airplane window as I flew over at 30,000 ft.  Ive taken some great outdoor shots as well.  When you buy a $70 camera with no optical zoom and 3.2 megapixels why would you expect perfect shots without some operator effort?  I say, be patient with it and figure out what works best and you'll be happy with this camera as a fun, travel camera for vacations or just amusing day to day adventures.

I had a Canon A540 which I liked and wanted a replacement.  I (foolishly) assumed that an A560 would retain the A540 features while upgrading to Digic III and 7.1 megawhatevers.  WRONG!  The A560 has different (less sophisticated) controls, does not have as many shooting modes, no manual mode, and burst speed is dog-slow.  I went back to Amazon's website and read about the A570 which does have the A540 controls and features, adds image stabilization, upgraded DIGIC and pixels - and is only about $25 more.  I point out that this mistake is not a big deal due to Amazon's wonderful return service.  Good on Amazon, Bad on Canon for misleading product naming.

I suppose the camera is fine enough for a non-camera nerd, but for me, I felt the quality just wasn't there compared to other Samsung products I own.  The bulge on the side of the lens is very big and the pictures on the internet don't really show that.  Take my advice and if you are planning on buying this, go to an actual store and check it out in real life.  I ended up sending it back without even trying it out because I was so unimpressed with the shape and size.

Battery life is terrible if you use image stabilizer, expect 25-30 shots on a full battery. Also the camera lacks of an optical view finder. Very difficult to shoot in sunlight with LCD. Many shots are somewhat bleached out while using auto white balance. Owned a stylus 400 digital prior to this and it is a dissapointment rather than upgrade. The only upsides are the 5x optical zoom which is a little choppy, and the image stabilizer that kills the battery if left on.

I was very disappointed with this camera.  The description says it has a digital stabilization mode but you couldn't prove it by me, as so many photos turned out blurry.  Another huge problem was its slow shutter speed, as time after time, I would lose a shot when friends using other cameras and snapping their shots at the exact same time as me got their photos. One important consideration:  the camera does not have a view finder, only the LCD monitor on which to center the image.  Perhaps I'm hopelessly old fashioned but I really missed the view finder as using it helps to stabilize the camera and makes centering the image so easy.  It takes steady hands to hold a camera at arms length, find and center an image and click the shutter--no wonder the shaky photos.  But perhaps the worst failing of the LCD monitor is the glare factor on a sunny day.  It makes it very difficult if not impossible to see any image on the screen.

I Bought three of these camera's for my business. I needed them to be able to take and store large quantities of pictures, so I ordered a few 2.0GB SD cards only to find out that this camera "IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH 2 GB SD MEMORY CARDS; your camera accepts a maximum 1 GB SD card". That should be listed with the technical details. It doesn't even say that on the box or in the Users Manual, I got the info from that website. STUPID...The camera is fine for the basics, I would equate it to a disposable film camera.

You can't purchase this product if you have an APO box. Don't bother. If it can be connected to an electrical outlet, Amazon won't ship it. Sort of a shotgun approach to retail, but that is Amazon these days. I tried to buy a UV filter for my camera, but because it falls within a particular category, Amazon is too blinded to differentiate. Sad. Hire a few more starving programmers to set up a better filter.

After reading comments, and comparing again and again the choices and gradings of an array of compact digital cameras of different brands, I finally decided to purchase this camera.  In view of its high grading by both experts and enthusiasts, I ordered this Canon A560 from Amazon website.  Tried it at home, the image appears to be washed out, the video taken has the same problem.  Images taken in broad day light also appear to be washed out.  The night view outside taken from the Sears Tower is horrible.  My father has a Nikon; My sister has a Sony.  The night images taken from their cameras are sharp and clear.  The images taken from my new Canon A560 is nothing but blurs.  I am so disappointed that I have to have this camera returned.

Up until yesterday this camera would have gotten 5 stars. It just started to get error "lens error, restart camera" regardless of whether it was in replay mode or camera mode. We have since discovered that Canon service is awful. Before you send the camera in for service you must either call them or write them an email. You will then get a reply in about two days giving you instructions on returning the camera. Once they receive it, it will take about ten days to get back to you. By the time all of this is done, you have lost almost 30 days of use. I have been searching the web to only find out now that this seems to an all too common problem not only with this model but with other Canon digital cameras as well.

I ordered this after my older Casio Exilim got dropped and broke. The things I like about Canon Powershot in general over the Exilim: MUCH easier to switch between modes (photo, movie, review etc), automatically flips your photos the right way when you review/download them (how do they do that? so cool!). As for this particular camera, it was easy to use but very small. I personally didn't like the boxy look though I read that it is allegedly easier to grip (and I did drop my less-boxy Exilim, after all). I also found the 2.5" LCD small after the Exilim. The shutter seemed slow indoors in not-particularly-low light, but I'd only had it for a couple days so maybe could have played with the settings if I'd known how.Would have kept the SD1000, but our battery did not seem to be functioning right -- we only got a few hours out of a fully charged battery (and it's not like we were leaving it on), sometimes had trouble turning the camera on when it was just charged, and constantly got messages to recharge soon after charging. I think this was probably a fluke because I haven't seen anything else about it... but that defect combined with my feelings of LCD smallness was enough for me to return it and "upgrade" (though you lose the optical viewfinder) to the SD750 (huge 3" display). It was only about $30 more on Amazon -- We'll see how that one goes.

Bought it for my mom's birthday. Decided to compare picture quality indoors with my good old Fuju FinePix F30. Oh, why did I do it? :( At ISO 1600 my oldie kicked Canon's behind really hard. My mom loves taking pictures indoors :( Sorry, mom.

Yes, it is small and handy to carry around, easy to use if you just want point and shoot but, my camera has broken for the second time in the 2 1/2 months I have owned it.The power button has failed for the second time since purchasing the camera in June 2007. I sent it off for repair, and while the people on the phone are very nice, it really doesn't get you anywhere. One email from the tech people said that I would have my camera back in approximately 7 business days, another said approximately 10 days and when I called to check they said they were still waiting on a part. Obviously, those estimates don't mean a thing, and apparently, time at the repair center doesn't mean a thing because I have had my camera back just over a week and it is broken again. I called Canon and they said just send it back for more repair.  Great!  Here we go again, but hey! I just got off the phone with Amazon and they said they will take the camera back and give me a refund!  Thank you Amazon!!

I purchased this camera to snap off some photos when I moved to Vancouver for school (I left my other camera on the other side of the country) and it's one of the worst mistakes I've ever made. When it's not taking blown out white pictures or pitch black images, it's snapping off blurry or orange tinted images. I brought my first one back for another one- the same problem!(And before anyone says that I just don't know how to use it, keep in mind that I've been a photographer for a few years.)Add to that the countless number of reviews for this camera for the same problems that I'm having and you get one bottom line- THIS CAMERA IS A DUD!I'll never buy another Sony camera again in my life. In fact, as the go-to-guy for my friends when buying tech gear, I've told them to stay away from Sony cameras from introductory to professional. I'm sticking with my Nikon from now on. This is possibly the worst camera I've ever used (and that says a lot)

I love everything about this camera but the image quality.  Although the camera has a built in guide that not only tells you how to take the best shot, but automatically adjusts the settings to the correct mode, most images are fuzzy, especially if printing anything larger than 4X6.   This Olympus camera has so many marvelous features from the large size LCD to the slim, light shell, that it is a great shame the image quality is so poor.

I bought this for my boyfriend because I'm a college student with only so much money.  We found it to be a good camera for the price... quality pictures, good battery life, easy to handle, etc etc.  Unless you're a photographer, for$56 this is an exceptional camera that gives you just about everything a camer costing $200 would.            But that was before it broke in less than 2 months while sitting on the shelf on its  own.  The screen simply leaked and that was that... I realize now that I made the mistake of buying a piece of electronic that's not Japanese.  I know Canon PowerShot SD1000 is more expensive, but whatever the price this camera felt flimsy to begin with while my PowerShot always gave me the feeling that I'm holding a chunk of solid metal.

For years I have had my old Samsung Digimax 300 of 3.2 mp, And let me tell you that is a pretty good camera, I'm using even now, and the quality of the pictures it is great, so, when my brother gave me some weeks ago the Polaroid Izone 300 I was very exciting about my new camera, cos I thougth this one it could be the choosen one to replace my old camera.But the whole thing it was a complete dissappointment, I mean, I can not compare the quality of the pictures of my old Samsung Digimax (it is almost 4 years with me!!!) with this new one Polaroid iZone.So if you are looking for a new, cheap and good Digital Camera, I suggest to buy a Samsung Digimax, maybe of 5 mp, you can find it here, in amazon for less than US$ 100 I think... actually I am very exciting cos I am waiting for my new Sony Cybershot DH 2, a more powerfull camera than my old Digimax, so I think that camera will be a decent replacement of my old camera, but avoid to buy this one, trust me!!!

I purchased this product after reading so many good reviews about it. Yet just like many other frustrated reviewers here, I found out the picture quality is poor: very grainy indoor or outdoor shots, no matter what settings I use. Since it received so many good reviews too, the only explanation I can think of is that I might get a lemon. Finally I returned it. Thanks for Amazon's excellent return policy, I was able to get all my money back.

It has has a view screen that you can not see in sunlight, and I don't mean hard to see, I mean it is black. There is no way you can compose a picture in bright sun. With this camera, you would be just pointing and praying you got the shot you wanted. Tech support suggested a screen protector but that did nothing to improve the view. Battery life is terrible, good thing I purchased a spare. Otherwise this is a great little camera if most of your shots are indoors.

I bought this camera for a special trip to my 30th HS class reunion. At first I liked that it was light and easy to use and with enough features and capacity for it's price. Then at my main event it stopped working. I got a "lens error" message and the lens got stuck. Before that, it would turn off without any reason while aiming to shoot (batteries was not an issue). Unfortunately I got stuck with the "lemon" but for such a big event, it's unforgivable, it ruined my trip and I ended up buying Kodak disposables.  No more Nikons for me.

A    good starter camera. If you never used a digital camera before this one is for you. Easer to operate then a film camera turn the dial to auto and snap away. I got it for our 8 year old she mastered it and was taking pictures in five minutes an older women relative who never even seen one before was Abel to master it in two.It doesn't have all the gadgets or settings that the others have but that is part of it's appeal for older or younger picture takers. If you can use a film camera you can use this digital. You might even be able to use this one if you cant figure out a film camera. And it takes just as good a picture as most film cameras.In short if you have been scared to go digital because you don't think you can figure out how to use it this one is for you.

The picture quality itself is decent.  However, my camera will now only take one picture before indicating that the batteries are low and shutting off.  I've only had it since July.  I haven't even used it that much.  The battery life has always been poor.  I replaced them several times on vacation.  I was only using the viewfinder to save power.  I thought Canon was a good brand, but I won't buy another one.

I just bought the Sony Cybershot DSCW55 camera the other day to replace my Sony Cybershot DSC-P200, purchased in January 2006, which has already been discontinued.  I wanted a camera that would work with the accessories I had for the DSC-P200, namely the memory card and battery.  Well I just tried to memory card and it does not fit!  Battery is different also.  Grr.  Otherwise the camera seems fine for day to day purposes.  I  find digital cameras, particularly those with telescoping lenses, break easily.  I purchased the third party protection plan, so I have my fingers crossed.

I love Fuji digital cameras and have worked with them for years.  The S700 came loaded with the features I wanted, but the optics were really poor, the light metering was questionable at best and the auto focus plain sucked.  It also was lighter than I'm used to, which gave it an overall "low consumer level" feel.  It's a cam with lots of bells and whistles that only work so well.  I traded it in 3 days later and, still loyal to Fuji, bought the S6000fd for a bit more money and WOW! what a camera!  It surpassed and continues to surpass my expectations every day.  The shots I'm getting of my art work now rival those of a pro I hired to do the job a few months back.  If you want the features of the S700 in a camera that actually works to support those features (especially in the auto focusing department), get the S6000 instead.

I got this free when I bought a laptop late last year, and even then, it's barely a value at that price.As other reviewers have said, the picture quality (yes, at the highest quality settings) is barely better than the &lt;1 MP camera in my cheap-o cellphone. Whether using the flash or taking in a well-lit environment, you'll still need a rock-steady arm to avoid getting a big blurry mess.I had hoped this little free camera, cute as it was, would at least help me get by after my old Fuji 3MP camera was stolen. I didn't expect it to match the Fuji's quality, but this extreme difference is inexcusable. Instead, I've gone back to using my 35mm film camera and scanner.If you actually decide to pay money for this camera, well, I feel very sorry for you. Please spend a few bucks more and find a REAL camera...

This was my first digital camera. I bought it with rather high expectations, thinking that at 3.2 mega pixels it would have rather good display and other qualities. The things that bothered me most were the over-bright flash (which washed out the color of every photo I took with it, even outside at night) and the inadequate zoom. The display was pretty good for a camera at this price, but many things could've been improved. My advice to you: look around a bit more before settling on this camera. You may find it wasn't what you expected.

I have this camera for work, in a job I should take 100+ pics a day to document my work.Yes, this camera is easy to use and takes decent pics.The bad side: it eats batteries like crazy. The worst part of this camera is that after every 4-5 pics taken in succession, a "processing" graphic comes up on the LCD screen, and I need to wait 30-45 seconds before I can take another pic. Of the 15 co-workers who were given this camera as well as me, they experience the same issue.Once the processing is done, a majority of times, it goes back to processing after each image taken. This is really annoying.I tried using one of my personal hi speed SD cards instead of the dollar store SD card that work supplied, and the same result. It makes no difference whether the batteries are new or used. If you wish to take two or three pics, then shut the camera down... this would be a great inexpensive camera.I sure am glad I am on the clock when using this camera. For my personal camera needs, I'd never accept this camera... there would be too many missed shots. I'll stick with my Panasonic Lumix for personal use.

Item returned. I have an refurbished Kodak easyshare digital camera and the zoom lens sometimes would not function so i wanted to get a new one. After much research i decided to purchased this camera because of the good review... Not happy. My old kodak that I purchased on ebay and 3 times cheaper takes better pictures than this. The images looked good from the 2inch lcd screen but once i uploaded to my computer, pictures were not that good, not what I would expect from a canon. Also not impressed with video capability.

I was rather unimpressed with this camera given the rave reviews. Here are my top complaints:1) BIG DELAY between when you depress the shutter button to take the picture and when the camera actually takes the picture. I really do not like this; I want the camera to capture when I press, not afterwards. This isn't a huge problem when taking stills but for action, kids, people, or anything else that tends to move, this is a BIG problem. 2) Blurry results. Another reviewer was right that when you download you will notice a significant blur to photos you can't see as well on the LCD screen when taking photos. I got better results when I turned off the face recognition feature but I am still highly disappointed with the lack of image sharpness and difficulties correcting the blur from one condition to the next.3) ONLY USES LCD to frame the photo; I prefer the ability to view through an eye piece when I need precision.4) LCD screen is such a significant portion of the camera, it is impossible not to touch it with fingers and hand thus smudging the screen. I constantly find myself trying to clean the screen. Since the screen is the only way to view and frame your shot, this is very, very frustrating - I like a clean screen.  Overall, I have buyer's remorse. I cannot recommend this camera. I prefer to carry around a faster, bulkier SLR. My search for a relatively good 'pocket' camera continues.

I was disappointed with the product because I thought it had a zoom feature for taking pictures at a distance.  It does not.  This camera should only be used for close up pictures.

First of all, I would just like to say that the camera feels cheap.. the buttons are made of cheap breakable plastic. BAD SONY.. (SAYS A LOT ON THE STATUS OF THE COMPANY) which you have to take extra care for.. I bought the W55 pink with case for my girlfriend for our anniversary. I was really expecting a lot from the camera. but just after 2 ... I REPEAT 2 HOURS of total use.. the camera's LCD STARTED SHOWING LINES ON THE SCREEN.. I mean what the... it was never dropped or broken whatsover. I gave the gift late at night so she wasnt able to use it that much. The next morning, she turns on the camera and there.. lines started showing up whenever you take photos.. Amazon I would like a refund or a replacement for this pls.. DONT BUY THIS CAMERA BEWARE.. SONY IM VERY DISSAPOINTED..

After buying the S5 to replace my S3 I was very disappointed with the image noise as noted on another review here. This is not a Canon only problem and it's becoming a troubling trend as megapixels are added at the expense of image quality. It's not a matter of the S5 being better than the Sony H7 or H9, it's a matter of any of these cameras being able to equal their own previous generation model with regard to noise. The megapixel war is simply marketing nonsense unless you plan on printing wall posters or drastically cropping images. The fact is that only so many pixels can be put on the same size image sensor before the noise level becomes a problem and anti-noise electronic counter measures simply trade one problem for another.  My S5 went back to the store and I'll continue to use my S3. I'll miss the hot shoe and the new LCD viewing screen, but for me photography is more about images that camera features. Eventually the companies will probably come around, but until then you may want to regard ever higher megapixal ratings with suspicion.

CONS: Blurry Photos and Indistinguishable ZoomThis camera was a breeze to get setup and become completely familiar with all features, I did not mind that this camera does not have many features, but the one feature I miss is focus. I am returning this camera because of the poor quality of photo. The LCD shows a great shot, but the computer and television show a different quality. I am going to spend the few extra dollars and get a good camera.

I got this a couple of days back and have clicked a few snaps both indoor & outdoors ... close up, normal and max zoom.The shape and feel is same as most of the A series cameras. Surprisingly it felt lightweight with batteries & SD card.The colors come out good as canon pics always do. Some of the pics under the sun came out overexposed (auto mode) which came as a surprise to me. The greatest dissappointment is the time it takes after a snap is taken to process the pic and store it (considering its a Digic III processor). Mind you, I use a standard Sandisk 1GB SD Card. It takes a while for the flash to get re-charged. Also, I found the battery performance dissappointing.

As a documentary photographer I dislike digital cameras and think that in all respects except convenience they are inferior to 35mm SLR cameras. But sometimes sheer convenience trumps camera build quality and photo quality. In that case, this tiny and fragile point and shoot zoom has some things going for it. Compared with similar digitals it's as good or better. Ken Rockwell waxes enthusiastic about it on his website, but then his photos usually aren't made under difficult conditions. If you need something like this, it's a good value. For closeups and middle distance shots, under good lighting conditions, the resolution is acceptable, particularly on a computer monitor. The Canon software that comes with the camera is clunky but better than nothing. The price makes it a good value, today. Like all digitals, it will be obsolete in a few years if it's not broken.

I'm all for buying inexpensive cameras.  I know I'm no Ansel Adams, I just wanted a camera to bum around with.  One small problem, though.  You can't see through the screen to take a picture!  My photographer brother even tried to adjust it and he could do nothing to remedy the situation.  Don't buy this camera!

After reading all the reviews and hearing from friends with Sony cameras, I was really hoping for the best with this camera.  Unfortunately, I've been very disappointed.PROS: *IF* you are taking pictures of still objects in a lot of light, then camera will probably do just fine.  For example, it took some awesome pictures at a car show I went to last month.  I also had good luck at the zoo.  But that's about the only thing it's good for.CONS:Most importantly, even with still objects, the focus is often very soft/grainy.  Before you say it, yes, I've adjusted every setting I can, and I've thoroughly read the manual.  The pictures are just plain fuzzy.It's next to impossible to quickly grab focus on moving objects.  (My 1-year-old niece is a perfect example.)  Yes, the camera is compact, which makes it great for taking anywhere and capturing those spontaneous moments.  But the time it takes to grab focus makes it difficult to capture those moments.The flash badly washes out skin tones, regardless of ambient light settings.  I've been able to tweak the manual exposure setting with the flash manually turned off to get some decent photos.  But again, I wanted a point-and-shoot camera, not one that requires a lot of constant tweaking.Forget the low light/ISO 1000 setting.  The pictures have a tremendous amount of noise.Even with still objects in decent light, I often get a blurring/halo effect.  What makes this worse is that they may look fine on the camera screen, but once I view them on my computer, I notice the blur.The lack of a viewfinder is a real pain.  The screen is almost completely washed out in bright daylight.Bottom line, my experience is that I have to take MANY pictures to get a couple that MIGHT be decent.  Perhaps I was expecting too much for the price, but my advice is to pony up a few more bucks and get a Cannon.

Maybe it is too soon to be sure about it, but I think the red eyes reductor doesn't work well. I used to have another Canon, the A70, and the same system in the old camera was way better. One other point: it takes too long to save the image in the memory card. But, as I said, maybe I don't know yet how to operate the camera.

I bought this camera in a hurry because my other one unexpectedly broke. I don't like going anywhere without a camera. This one is ergonomically designed in a slight wedge shape making it easy to fall out of your pocket. I caught it before it hit the ground. Whew! Further, it is small so if you have large hands you probably don't want this one. The pictures were quite sharp. The viewing screen often whited out in bright, contrasty lighting situations and seemed unable to make a decent exposure in these conditions. I consider that defective. I took it back and got a thoroughly excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HAOVC6">Canon PowerShot A630 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom</a> instead. Very satisfied with the Canon!

Quality of the picture is average for a point and shoot.  User friendliness is average.  With only the screen to frame your picture bright sunlight can be a problem.The biggest downside to this camera is battery life.  Eight pictures and the camera shuts down.  Upon checking the battery with a  battery indicator  power indicator they still register high to normal power.  So..if you aren't taking more than a dozen pictures you might be able to accomplish that feat with just two batteries.

I purchased this camera 6 months ago. After 5 months of use, at my daughters birthday party no less, the screen broke. I sent it back for repair and was told my warranty was void because the damage was caused by "impact". I know for a fact that indeed there was no misuse or impact. I believe it was faulty manufacturing and a weak screen. So here I am after only 6 months of use, without a camera. I could pay $111.00 to have it fixed, but instead I am going to purchase a good camera. A Canon. I had my Canon Powershot Elph for 7 years. That camera had been flung around, dropped, and drooled on and it still works. So, if you want a camera that lasts, and a company with good customer service, DONT BUY A SONY. Thank you for reading.

The latest trend in point and shoot cameras is the lack of a viewfinder. This makes taking pictures outdoors on a sunny day nearly impossible. If you actually want to know what's going to show up in the picture, this camera is virtually useless in sunlight. You may not use the viewfinder on a digital camera very often but, when you need one, it's frustrating not to have one. There are better cameras, with a viewfinder in the same price range.Indoors, the camera takes average pictures. The colors are somewhat washed out and at lower resolutions the pictures are a little blurry. On the positive side, the stabilizer works well and pictures at higher resolutions are generally clear and sharp. The included software is cheap junk meant to sell you an upgrade.

When the camera arrived, we charged the battery and it did not function at all. I contacted Amazon and spoke with a very pleasant and helpful young woman who quickly ordered us another identical camera which was mailed to us by 2 day shipping and the return for the non-functioning camera was facilitated. I was impressed with the Amazon customer service and I hope that the second camera will work well for a long time. We have overall had excellent luck with Olympus cameras in the past. The second camera works very well.

My old Olympus just quit working one day, and at a very inconvenient time and place.  However, I'd invested in Olympus memory cards, so...This camera is much more versatile and takes even better pix than my old one.  I've already used it extensively and have been very pleased with the results in general.  Some squibs:Low light still does not produce outstanding results, unless you use the flash.  While there is an "anti-shake" feature, I'm not sure it works as well as I might need (given my age and condition).Redeye is still an issue, just like with my old Oly.And, finally, since the lens is so, so tiny, high-res pictures can still leave a "muddy" quality.  I've enlarged some of the high-res work and could still see "mud" at some extreme magnifications.It's a great camera overall, though, and you won't be disappointed.  That is, until it breaks...

I bought this camera in April and by the end of July it was useless due to a cracked LCD screen. Constantly kept in a case, always attached to wrist while  in use, and never dropped. There was no apparent damage to the external portion of the screen. I returned it to Canon for repair and they declared the damage my fault (impact/pressure) and want to charge me $100 to fix. It was a great camera while it lasted but way too fragile.

I don't think i have ever commented on anything before but I felt compelled this time around. I got my new SD1000 just a week ago and I must say while it is stylish and takes pictures very quickly... a very intuitive interface, very easy to use and the battery charges quite quickly..not everything is great....The biggest and most important issue i have is that it takes VERY poor pictures if the lighting isn't optimal. Most of my pictures come out with very grainy and this is with the auto ISO set or off. I have owned other Canon cameras and the quality of this one is by far the poorest to date. Very disappointed. I can't return the camera so I am either going to try and sell it or hand it over to younger sisters. I will have to get another cam now. *sigh*. Oh, it doesn't do video capture zoom either so take note.

Using the two included Panasonic alkaline batteries the unit came from, I ran out of juice after taking a dozen pictures and transferring one (as test) to my computer. My old, battered, taped-together Nikon Coolpix 5200 (does everybody have trouble with broken battery doors on Coolpix units?) *never* gave me a low-battery warning. The rechargeable battery seems to run forever - I recharge it "preventatively" every 5-6 weeks! The Samsung may be OK for the money in other respects, but this kind of power management snafu pretty much turned me off the brand altogether.

I have owned several Sony cameras, and this is the first one to disappoint me. This was purchased to replace a Sony T7 that was lost. The camera is a convenient size, the video quality is pretty good, but the noise is far more than I would expect from a Sony. I have a Sony camera that records on CD, and it takes amazingly noise free photos at even extended shutter speeds (several seconds). That camera processes out the noise on longer exposures. This camera has huge amounts of noise above the 200 ISO, in certain colors. Unfortunately, skin tone is one of those colors, and any shots taken indoors at a high enough ISO to avoid flash will make your subjects look like they are wearing coats of many colors. The noise can be reduced by processing, but then all detail is lost. Sorry Sony, I had hoped for more. I can't recommend the camera, as I now wish I had spent more money to get a more useful camera for real world photography.

I was in Walmart looking for a digital camera, and came across this cute little thing. I saw it was a 3.2 MP, being a decent picture. I was sold solely on the compact look,the price and i assumed it has alright quality. (the pic's took ok in the store but only b/c of how bright it is in there)I got it home, and took a few shots, they were no good. so i thought id keep it for the weekend and play around with it, thinking i needed to get to know my camera. WRONG!! this thing doesnt get better!!! its horrible. the quality is crappy. the pictures blurr. the flash is delayed for 10 sec. u cant take a pic closer than 5 ft away from object (ex. fun pics of u and ur friends/family where u hold it out in front on you) the pics will come out white!!! BAD BUY!!! WASTE OF MONEY!! BEWARE

I was disappointed by the product. I really would rather return it. But don't want to go through the trouble.I guess for a 7.1 MP, the price is good. But it is Red-Eye reduction almost does nothing. I have it set on, but most of the pictures I took at a night event, almost everybody got red eyes.If I have known this, I definitely would not buy this camera.I have an old sony cybershot (got it in 2000). I nenver had even on red-eye.I would go for Sony next time.Cannot complain the other stuff.

With this camera, I think, you can take good quality pics but there is something wrong about recording video. Because, when you watch videos recorded by W55, you hear a very annoying sound like a machine is working inside the camera..I returned my camera to Amazon two days after I received..

I'm on the border of giving this 2 stars, but have opted for 3 stars since the pictures are decent for the price of the camera.  Gripe #1: the boot-up speed; when turning the camera on, it takes 4 seconds before it is ready to take a picture.  Gripe #2: processing speed between photos; another 3 seconds in between pictures.  There is a setting which allows for taking rapid photos, but I believe you lose image quality in this mode.  Grip #3: the provided computer cable (for downloading the pictures) is a micro USB connection (unlike most camera's mini USB connector (e.g. Canon digital cameras)).  The only reason this bothers me is I'm short on USB ports, and I already have a mini-USB hooked up for my Logitech remote control. Now I have to take up another port for this camera. Gripe #4: power-save mode is confusing.  The camera shuts itself off after a certain length of time, and getting it back on was a bit confusing.  There were at least 2 occasions during the first weekend of use where it went into sleep-mode, and I tried waking it up by pushing the power button. I don't know if the camera was just slow to respond, and so I hit the power button again, but all of a sudden the camera is turning off (the lens goes back in).  Whatever the case was, I was fiddling with the camera for 15 seconds before it was ready to take the picture (which I ended up missing because of the delay).I'm returning it today, and buying the Canon PowerShot A550.  The price is equivalent, and Canon has not let me down (especially with the boot-up and in-between processing times).

I bought this camera new and on the 4th time I went to use it, it did not work.  After several times to unsuccessfully change batteries, I phoned the Kodak service repair.  They were unable to help troubleshoot and asked me to send $69.00 plus shipping and the camera for them to look at and repair if possible.  I asked to talk to a supervisor but their response was "they are too busy".  Why would I spend $69.00 on a camera that costs less than $100 and not even know if it is repairable.  I wouldn't wish this camera on the most unfortunate person.  I will never buy another Kodak product because of this.  There are too many other good products out there.  Buyer beware!

The pictures are grainy, not as good quality as my old 4 MP EasyShare.    I was disappointed, but wanted to make sure, so I compared the photo quality side by side onscreen of the new 5 MP C530 with my old 4MP EasyShare (using the same subject).   The 4 MP has better resolution than the new 5MP C530, which is not what you'd expect.  Kodak unfortunately seems to have taken a step backwards with this camera, and is advertising this as a higher quality camera than the old 4 MP EasyShare.  Too bad, as I've used Kodak for years, but will look elsewhere now.  I returned the C530 to Amazon the same day I bought it.

Best investment I ever made.  I love the camera, love all the features and the fact that it is slim.  Takes great clear, crisp pictures.  Love all the shooting modes.  Great everyday camera and with a 1g card it can take lots of pics.  Battery life is also pretty good.  One suggestions buy a good case for it, for the LCD's are sensitive.

I was so dissapointed with this camera! I purchased a Sony Cybershot 3 years ago and, it had been such a great camera, I automatically thought this newer model would be great. Almost every picture I took was either blurry or the light areas of the picture were blown out! As an experienced Cybershot user, I tried all settings to fix the problem, but no luck. Terrible for capturing a child's first steps, as the description says. Would not recommend.

I read all the great 5 star reviews on Amazon, and decided on buying the Fuji S700. Shipping via Amazon was prompt as always.The camera looked fine. but when I started to take pictures, the pictures were grainy and washed out, especially when viewed on a HDTV.I compared them to a 7.2M Sony W55 camera purchased by my son the day before. A world of difference. Not grainy, very sharp with vivid colors. I checked the settings on the S700, took pictures in low light and day light - no good. I will return the S700 today - shame it did not live up to the numerous great reviews.

For the price it may be an all right camera but the few sample shots I took didn't seem to have nearly the clarity of pictures taken with my Fuji digitals.  I didn't have the camera long basically because the layout of the buttons and menus was very different than my Fuji mind could tolerate.  I do love the black body though!  As to the battery life, everyone is right. It will destroy a fresh set of alkaline batteries in a few shots - but that's typical for many digital cameras.  By the way, I never found out how to get the icons off the LCD while taking pictures and the manual is almost worthless.

I like Olympus products, but am not extrememly impressed with this particular camera. For a point and shoot and someone who doesn't want to do anything manually, this camera is great.  It has all the functions you want on a point and shoot (small, compact, large LCD screen, 5x zoom, IS, 7 MP, etc.) but does not have any manual controls whatsoever.  It takes good pictures, as long as you have the right scene selection.  Also, the LCD screen is great indoors and at night, but during the day with any sunlight, it is almost impossible to see.  I didn't think this would be such a problem (after being warned about this issue by other consumers) but it is, especially if I want to hand over the camera to someone else to take a shot.

When I saw this camera, I was impressed with the cool features (for relatively low price), so I bought it and using it for six months now. Now here is the problem, when you change camera's picture mode, to "available light", "candle", "indoor" etc. picture comes out grainy. I tried all most every single option to resolve (i.e. changing the picture size) this problem but had no luck so far. Camera works fine in bright light or using portrait mode. I have used Nikon Coolpix 4.0 in the past, and it has no such issues.

Canon is still manufacturing flawed cameras that will fail many people shortly after the warranty has expired.  This has been an ongoing problem since the Powershot S1 IS, but Canon refuses to acknowledge the problem or even fix it out of warranty.The camera will not doubt get many good reviews.  It has many good things going for it.  Good layout and takes good pics.  As long as you pay the ransom of $120 to get it fixed, with no guarantee that the problem will not return, or just spend another $400-$500 on their latest/greatest camera you will be able to keep taking these good pics.Buyer Beware!I was one of the ones burned by the manufacturing flaw!

The canon powershot is a camera that takes decent pictures.  However, I can say that I have been disappointed by some features of the camera:1. Clunky and confusing interface2. No cradle included3. USB cable doesn't charge camera...you have to take battery out and charge separately.4. Poor battery life.I was just disappointed b/c I figured with as long as canon has been making powershots that they would have it down to a science by now...however, there is still work to be done.  :(

Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Like many I had tons of problems with the Canon A520. See my review.So I am getting ready to go on vacation again, India this time, and I need to replace the second A520 that decided to quit working. I went to my local big box electronics store to find a new camera. I spent about 2 hours looking at all the contenders. I loath using the LCD to take a picture, leftover from years of using real cameras I guess. So the field is very limited now. Why??? Some nice camera out there but...I gravitate to the Canons. I have used the A20 and A520 so the A560 feels comfortable and familiar, and my wife won't have to learn a new system. Canon also just seems more intuitive in its controls. But I think the lens looks like the one on my piece of garbage A520, but Canon must have fixed the pervasive problem, wouldn't they? I get home and take tons of worthless pictures, turning the camera on and off a lot, just to see if it guits working. This time before I reach a foreign country where getting a replacement is expensive. Camera seems okay. A few days later my beautiful Golden Retriever strikes a stunning pose on our first nice spring day and I grab the camera and snap a shot. @^#%&*@%$ The damn lens cover doesn't open all the way and I miss the shot. Just one time so far but that's how the A520 started. I plan to take it back today. I have been a Canon user for 36 years and I am so pi**ed. I agree with other reviewer problems about slowness. I thought they worked this out too. I also wished they hadn't dropped the aperature and shutter priority exposure modes leaving the user very little control over camera. Obviously Canon is obviously aiming lower.I am probably going to get a Nikon. Oh the blasphemy to Canon user.

This camera was great for its first month. Then I took it to Borneo with me to do some wildlife photography. I completed around 20 photos on a new set of batteries, and the camera reported "Change the Batteries." So I did. The message would not go away. I tried replacing the batteries with new sets of batteries 4-5 times, all to no avail. When I later traveled to Java, the camera seemed to work normally again. My suspicion is that the humidity in Borneo was just too high for the camera (the user guide says standard operating range for humidity is 10-90), but from now on I cannot rely on this Canon S5-IS to be working when I need it. I must always carry a spare, back-up camera.

I bought this camera and I am very satisfied,  but it has a downside; you can not use this camera for take night pictures, because the screen is so dark that you can not see the subject.You almost have to guess. I can not believe that my HP Photosmart E327 5MP was much better in this way.

After downloading the full PDF manual (which you can find on the U.S. fuji site) and then auditioning this camera in person for about 2 hours while taking over a hundred test shots, I finally decided to pass on purchasing the Fuji s700, and went with a Kodak z612 instead.The two cameras offer very similar features at about the same price, but the Kodak z612 has a wider 12:1 zoom range (with really great optical performance) and it has TRUE image stabilization (which the Fuji s700 lacks despite their marketing claims).If most of your shots are taken in full daylight out doors, or with a flash indoors, then the Fuji s700 can provide fine pictures, but in lower light situations, it suffers due to it's use of a tiny 1/2.5 inch CCD.When it comes to the low light performance of the CCD image sensor used in these cameras, SIZE MATTERS, and unfortunately the CCD used in the s700 is much smaller than some earlier Fuji models.To be fair the Kodak z612/z712 and Canon S3 IS offerings also use these tiny 1/2.5 inch CCD's, but those cameras help offset this by offering true mechanical image stabilization to help out in low light situations.You may recall that Fuji was the company that unsuccessfully tried to push the megapixel race into ridiculous fantasy land of marketing hype with `interpolated' resolution on some earlier cameras (fortunately the s700 rates an HONEST 7 megapixels), and now they are back at it with their claim that this camera has `image stabilization'.What the S700 DOES have is roughly the equivalent of the `sports' or `action' modes you find on virtually ALL other cameras which simply try to kick up the ISO rating and use the fastest possible shutter speed to freeze action and prevent motion blur.Unfortunately this also increases noise in the image, because it is basically the electronic equivalent of using faster (but much grainer) 400 to 1600 ASA film in a 35mm camera to shoot at the faster shutter speeds needed to stop action.Sure a noisy but sharp `hi-iso' picture is better than a totally smeared picture due to camera shake, but mechanical stabilizers (like the Kodak z612, z712 or Canon Powershot S3 IS have) can cancel out the camera shake and let you shoot at a lower ISO equivalent setting WITHOUT adding noise, so it's important to understand that Fuji's claimed `image stabilazation' mode is NOT equivalent to mechanical image stabilizers you find on some other camerasFuji had some claim to this function being a reasonable substitute for a mechanical stabilizer on some earlier models like the S6000FD (and even smaller point and shoot's like the F30) because of their use of larger high performance CCDs in those models (which made these cameras much better able to work in HI-ISO mode needed to make this feature effective), but unfortunately the S700 uses the same tiny 1/2.5 inch size CCD as their competition, so it's `hi-iso' performance is not on a par with Fuji's earlier offerings and does NOT make the `image stabilizer' mode very effective.In fact, because of the tiny 1/2.5 CCD used by nearly all these compact 10:1 and 12:1 superzooms, former Fuji F30 users seeking to upgrade will probably be VERY disappointed in the low-light shooting performance, and would be much better off trying to catch a sale on something like the Fuji S6000FD (which I see selling now for only about $265 after a 50 dollar rebate) or a low end DLSR like the Nikon D40 (the D40 has a CCD with literally 10 times the surface area of the one used in the s700 which let's it take great shots in natural light all the way up to ISO 1600).

I purchased this product in February of 2007.  It is now September and I have not been able to use it since July.  One day it just started acting really weird, the power button was flashing, which means the battery is dead, but even after repeated charging it still would not work.  I purchased a new battery to see if maybe something had happened to the original one and it still did not work.  Per Sony's customer support I sent it to their camera repair center.  Of course, they called me and told me that they could not duplicate the problem.  I told her that it would work for a short period of time only with a fully charged battery and she said the technician would wait a while and try it again.  It came back 2 days later and it still doesn't work.  Sony's customer support, in Tel-Aviv or wherever, told me to send in my charger to the same repair center since they claimed my camera worked correctly.  That came back as well, apparently they don't fix accessories.  The customer service guy told me that they usually just tell people to buy a new charger, which is $59.99.  The "accessories" are supposed to be under warranty as well though, so why should I pay for another charger when the one they gave me is faulty? Now I have to send my camera back to the repair center, again, so they can fix it for real this time.  Meanwhile, my camera still doesn't work, 3 months later.I will never buy a Sony product again, after all this BS.  I have to pay to ship it each time as well, and I am fed up!

I bought this camera and it took great pictures, at least until I took it out of the case one day (only 2 weeks after I bought it!) to discover that the LCD screen had shattered internally.I saw that other Canon camera reviews warned that the LCD was prone to breaking, but I figured the Canon brand was trustworthy enough to provide great customer support/repair if that were to happen.I was wrong.25 days since Canon received my camera for repair and 2 customer service calls to check on the status of my camera repair: still no camera.  The Canon rep I just spoke to on the phone said the camera parts should arrive within another 2 weeks (5 weeks after receipt of camera), and that cameras would be repaired in order of receipt.  Then, she matter-of-factly stated that some cameras in the repair shop have been in there "for two to three months" and they still hadn't gotten to them, yet somehow her logic still compelled her to say that they would start repairing mine after the parts were received after 2 weeks.  When I asked if there was anyone I could complain to, she sarcastically replied "I'm listening," before transferring me to her supervisor.Her supervisor basically reiterated the company line, saying "parts are ordered overseas from Japan," "it takes some time for them to arrive from a foreign country," and that the repair confirmation e-mail and repair policy, which stipulates 7-10 business days for repair and return, does have the following caveat: "Actual times may vary. Seasonal volume or repairs requiring special parts may add more time," which is the catch-all for circumstances like this in which, as the supervisor put it, camera servicing may take "more than 30 days to order parts and complete the repair."  He provided no possible remediation at all, just served as another complaint buffer, and offered to continue referring me to further supervisors, which presumably would have just reiterated the company's repair caveat: "Actual [repair] times may vary."If you dare, buy the camera -- it was a great camera for 2 weeks until it broke -- but cross your fingers that it doesn't ever need to be repaired.  Otherwise, you may experience the disappointment that compelled me to write this review.

I purchased this camera two months ago and liked the camera, LOVED the 10X optical Zoom. It ends there though. The soft ware caused conflicts with my laptop and eventually crashed.  I recommended using your own software and not installing theirs, even though it says "install first" or "must install before using".  After a month of repairs to my laptop, I didn't reinstall it and things have been fine.  With that said, after two months, on a recent trip the LCD stopped working.  I called Fuji to find out what to do about it.  I had to send it back to them for repairs at my cost.  You have to go to the web site and fill out a form to go with the camera.  I sent it off today.  We'll see how the repair end holds up but I'm not holding my breath.  I'm looking for a new camera.

This is among the WORST customer service I have ever received in my history in the industry.  The item was damaged.  The company took calls on a what seemed to be a cell phone.  It took a week to get an answer, they did not offer to make what was wrong right.  They sent an invoice slip with no # on it or a return address.  The associate was rude.  You have been warned.

$ I just sent my camera in for repair to a location recommended by Kodak.  I just received an estimate of $85.00 plus shipping, to repair the MCU, whatever that is.  Anyway, as all may already know, this camera can be purchased here on Amazon for $95.00.  So you be the judge.  This camera should be advertised as a "disposable camera".  When it costs more to repair something than to replace, it's usually called junk.  Never again Kodak.  Once burnt twice shy.

Let me start by saying this: if you pay more than $40, and purchase this for someone over the age of 12, you will most likely not be satisfied. I would then down grade this to a 2star, because they could almost get the same results with their camera phone(with the exception of more mega pix w/izone).I purchased this for my 6yr old girls, and I think it will be a great 1st camera for them. (Xmas gift) The buttons on the camera are well place, it has a flash, a decent size lcd (1.5) monitor, which you can view your pictures(which I noticed alot of kids cameras at low prices you cannot). You can change the image size to get the most out of your internal 8mb (640x480 47pic, 1600x1200 9pic)you can add extra memory w/sep purchase of an sd card.It has a built in battery and comes with a charging dock so you dont have to keep on replacing batteries. It has a clear skin you can attach to the camera to protect it from mishaps, and still take pictures. The quality of the pictures are decent, the camera is slightly bigger than a credit card, and has nice look and feel. (I felt the Fisher Price cameras would be to babyish for my 6 1/2yr olds, plus too awkward to carry around, and the disney cameras you did not get the larger lcd screen plus lower mega pix and alot less features at a higher price).After intense searching for an inexpensive camera that would give me some of the same functions as a more expensive camera would, I am quite happy with my purchase, and I think my girls would be too. Shop around and try not to pay any more than $40, and I think you would be quite satsified.  I purchased one camera through Amazon and one on ebay for less than $35 incl. shipping.

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  IT IS ESSENTIALY A VERY EXPENSIVE DISPOSABLE CAMERA!!!  I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT ZERO OR NEGATIVE STARS BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THAT OPTION!I bought this camera about a year ago for my daughter because it is relatively inexpensive and Polaroid has been around a long time.  The picture quality was pretty lousy, but that really didn't matter since it was for a child...BUT, right from the start the battery did not charge...we assumed we were doing something wrong, and recently the camera was completely dead...we tried to find out how to change the battery and ended up contacting the company...this is the reply we received:Thank you for your recent email about your needs for service.There are no replacement parts available for the iZone 300 Digital Camera, including batteries.If you need to order a replacement part for your Polaroid product, please call us at 877-388-3779 during office hours.When you call us, please give the service agent your EMAIL ADDRESS so they can find you in our database for prompt processing of your request.Regards,Polaroid Technical SupportNot only is it crazy not to be able to replace the battery in a non-disposable type camera, but then they tell me to call to order replacement parts that they just told me don't exist...You're better off spending a little more and dealing with someone that supports their product, like Fuji or Canon...please beware!!!!

Ok, i'll try to help, got it yesterday. All the picture features are awesome the dual image stabilization really works...but at night the video funtion really deserve 2 star... i changed from a sony cybershot 6.0MP, i don't have any complain of the video quality. I did the change just for the Li-Ion Rechargeable Battery, image stabilization and all weather features of the stylus, i didn't see in any review about the video of the stylus...for the truth in places with bright light is fair, but at night is very poor the quality, i have changed the image quality the ISO 1600 and in low light the case is loss. Over all the all weather i really liked, haven't tested but i'll do it. Besides, i'll remain with the camera...Now i have almos one month with it, biside the video quality i have learned lot of thing and i would increase the scale to 4 stars, i tested the all weather feature in a place all my friend had to put the cameras away, my camera got very wet, every thing is fine...

To make a long story short, I recently switched to this camera after having a 3.2 MP Olympus Camedia camera for 3 years.I just took this camera on a camping trip and shot 80 pics.  There is not a single one in the bunch that comes anywhere close to the clarity and rich color that my old camera delivered.  The level of graininess is astoundingly bad.  I'm probably going to sell this thing within the next 2 weeks and go back to my Olympus.

I purchased this camera in May and it worked great at first, other than the videos being a little fuzzy, and not taking very good low-light pictures. But around the end of June the shutter started not opening and closing correctly, and the battery power didn't last. Now it isn't working at all. It won't even turn on with a charged battery. Dissapointing.

Im only 14 and im not radio shack but the camera is lacking in menu options and barely custimizable. There is only auto mode and no macro(up close shots). Also there is no manual mode, so you cant set it for a beach photo or set it for florescent lighting shots. The only thing you can really custimize is the flash.The thing that dissapoints me the most is the absence of auto focus. This camera is a kids toy. If your an artist and are into details i wouldn't reccomend this. If you dont know alot about digital cameras or dont like to spend alot of time fooling around with features i would reccommend it, its really a no brainer or if your not good with electronics. Im exchanging it for a camera with auto focus, macro etc. Basically one with more advanced features and can be custimized more. I dont know why people are complaining about the battery in this camera its ok, i meen what do they expect, all digital cameras have short battery life. There is a lithium battery pack you can buy for it but its fairly expensive. I paid $150 CDA which is slightly overpiced. The photo quality is pretty good but due to the lack of custamizable features your not always going to get what you want in every photo, espescially for jewlery or watches(up close shots).

We love the form factor, the ease of use, the ability to take *nice* video clips, and especially the online menu! There is some blur when taking action shots, but all in all, this is a nice camera. Unfortunetly, we have had to exchange our S710 2x due to the screen having internal hairline cracks - brand new and right out of the box. Now this one has cracked and OLYMPUS refuses to honor the warranty and fix it. Too Bad. This is a nice streamlined camera with great features. With customer service like Olympus, why would I ever buy another of their products?

I have owned the Canon A540 for a year and recently purchased an A570IS as an upgrade. The 540 had performed admirably, but I wanted image stabilization to allow shots with a slower shutter speed for pictures shot in rooms with low lighting using a low ISO setting for quality. I took over 200 shots at my son's wedding. The IS worked well, but the pics were too dark, so I reverted to flash shots to maintain the low ISO. To my great disappointment, MOST of the pics had redeye even when the subject(s) was not facing the camera. The in-camera redeye fix did not do well, especially when 6-8 people had redeye in the same frame. The 540 was never this bad.The outdoor photos, on the other hand, were extremely good with nice color and exposure and good focus. I couldn't be more pleased with those shots.But I really wanted a camera that could at least take decent indoor flash photos but preferably non-flash with medium ISO settings. In my experience, the 570 is not that camera. At this time there are digicams that excel at indoor photos and others that take great outdoor shots. I'll wait for a great all-arounder before my next purchase.P.S. Most of the shots were made in AUTO or PROGRAM mode.

this camera is okay except it has that common problem of breaking not too long after you buy it and leaves you with no other solution but to buy another camera NOT made by Canon.

this camera is a piece of junk. you have to be standing outside in bright sunlight to get a decent picture. and then when you try to use the flash it is so bright that everything in the foreground of the picture is washed out. not to mention the battery life is horrible. i got a 1 GB memory card so i could take lots of pictures, but the battery runs out after i took about 10. so all in all, if you're considering buying this thing, save the money and frustration and just don't.

I'm going to write a positive review of this camera, but you should know that I ended up returning it to Amazon because it didn't meet my specific needs.  I was looking for a high quality, inexpensive point and shoot digital camera when I bought this item. The reasons I returned it had nothing to do with the quality of its prints.  Let me make sure I say this: they were outstanding.  I loved the ease at which the A550 makes beautiful pictures.  What didn't do it for me was the size, and the lack of a panoramic mode.  The camera I ended up with, the $300 Canon SD700, is just so small that I slip it  into my pocket without thinking about it.  With the A550, I could never forget it was there.  This bulkiness lead to me not carrying it all the time, which led to pictures not being made that otherwise might have been.  If I had a purse though, or I just wanted something to take on occasional outings, the A550 would have been perfect.  If this is you, then get this camera.Lastly, I got excited about the 4x optical zoom.  Don't.  Bottom line is that, if you want to really zoom in but be able to take sharp photos, you need to invest in a SLR or DSLR camera system.  When I zoom in with the A550, even with my steady grip, pictures often come out quite blurry.Hope this helps.

Actually I wrote a bad review of this camera but, after sending Fuji some sample pics they believe I have a bad CCD sensor.SO I will return it and see if this is the problem.When it is fixed I will rate the camera again.

Arthur Schopenhauer once wrote:   "Truth goes through 3 stages:  First it is ridiculed, second it is violently opposed, and third it is accepted as self-evident truth." What you'll read below is more than merely my opinion. What you'll read are factual statements about this camera. This is a good camera except that it doesn't have a wide angle lens.  You need a wide angle lens to take those beautiful shots of sky/land/clouds and photos of large buildings and monuments like The Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris.  This camera also uses an expensive proprietary battery that is difficult to find at your local neighborhood drug and other stores.   I suggest you also look at The Nikon Coolpix P50 which I found to be a "better choice" than this one.So, why give it one star, you ask? I give it one star because, for me, I would NOT buy this camera in preference to the Nikon P50. Because I would not buy this camera, for me it only rates one star. That does not say that it is a "bad" camera regarding its picture taking capabilities. You may love the camera and if it were the only camera on the market I might also. But, for me and possibly for you, The Nikon P50 is a better choice.  If you wanna see some photos I took with the P50, send me an email:  boland7214@aolRegarding the proprietary battery as compared with AA batteries, when you are out on safari in Africa living in a thatched hut or tent and your proprietary battery runs out of power, do you want to be running all over the jungle at night in a fruitless attempt to find a battery at a local "sari-sari" store while you hear lions and hei-enas roaring and sounding off all around you? With the Nikon P50, you can easily carry enough AA batteries with you on your trip so you won't have to risk your life searching for the proprietary battery all over the jungle on those cold nights with wild animals searching for YOU! Got it? :o) PS: There is also a Canon SD800 which has a wide angle lens and an optical viewfinder. I like that one also. But the "killer" for me on that one is the proprietary battery necceary to operate the Canon SD800 over the use of AA batteries used in The Nikon P50 that are very cheap and you can find in almost any store in the world. PPS: Why do you need an optical viewfinder when you have an LCD screen? The simple reason is that the LCD's SOMETIMES get "washed out" in bright sunlight. And, another reason, I think, is that the optical viewfinder is "faster to use" under "pressure circumstances" like when you want to "grab" that smile on your kids face. Why not have both is my opinion. If you disagree fine, but two ways to view and take photos seems better than one. It's just common sense.  (Plus some people are "far sighted" and have difficulty clearly viewing a small LCD screen a few inches from their eyes.)So, you ask, "who needs a 28mm or 23mm lens?" You do! Most people concern themselves with how LONG is their telephoto lens. But, most people who "know" know that it is the WIDE ANGLE lens that is most important---most of the "best shots" are made with a WIDE ANGLE lens. For example, you're in Europe and you are trying to "get a shot" of that Cathedral of Notre Dame over there. You NEED a WIDE ANGLE lens. You are in the California Poppy Fields and you want to get the expanse of the golden-yellow poppy flowers with the huge blue sky filled with white clouds above---you need a WIDE ANGLE lens. You are sitting at thanksgiving dinner and you want to take a photo from the foot of the table with everyone sitting on the left and right---you NEED a WIDE ANGLE lens. You are in the garden of the California Mission and you want to take a photo of the ENTIRE garden surrounded by the mission walls---you NEED a WIDE ANGLE lens. It's Christmas day and you want a photo of the ENTIRE GROUP of visitors in front of the Christmas Tree---you NEED a WIDE ANGLE lens. This is where the 28mm lens (or 23mm on this camera) comes in! So, you NEED THIS CAMERA! Otherwise you'll be cutting off heads and leaving Aunt Sylvia out of the "Christmas Group Photo" this year---and she'll disinherit you and you'll live a life of poverty and misery everafter! :o) If you agree or disagree or know of ANY other digital point and shoot camera that has a WIDE ANGLE lens please write, Email:boland7214@aol.

I actually enjoyed the camera and thought it took pretty good photos. That was for the seven months that it worked. During a trip to Europe, I took some pictures, turned the camera off and then turned it on again a few minutes later to find the LCD not working. It was a bummer, but I thought not a big deal as I would have it taken care of under warranty when I got back to the states.I contacted Sony customer support, who directed me to mail the camera to a repair shop in Connecticut -- Precision Camera. They said I would have my camera back in seven to 10 days. Two weeks later, I received a letter from Precision Camera stating they concluded the LCD was broken due to impact damage, which wasn't covered under the warranty. I could pay $111 to have it fixed or I could have it shipped back unrepaired.I called Sony customer service again and explained to their first and second levels of customer relations personnel that the camera had not been dropped, hit or otherwise impacted. If it was impact damage that broke the LCD screen, it must have been the most subtle of impacts. They said they could do nothing for me and directed me to call the repair company.So I did, knowing what they would say. And they did. They told me their hands were tied and that the LCD was broken and the warranty voided. Even though I disputed the camera was damaged through any negligence on my part, they said they could do nothing. So I'm being shipped a broken camera.I'll simply shop around for another one, certainly not a Sony. I'll never buy another Sony product again.

I love the swivel LCD's that Canon uses and the features on the camera were really good..but there were enough drawbacks that I sent it back.What finally convinced me to send it back, was that it wouldn't Focus in Macro mode, many times it would be in focus when I let go of the button, but not when it was pressed half way...problem with software??? But it would focus in SuperMacro. and when I contacted Canon support, they replied as if I didn't know what I was doing...I upgrade cameras about once per year. I have SLR's for serious work, but these kind are the type I cary around with me all the time. The other complaints I had with the camera was that the battery compartment was so large that you had to remove your tripod quick release attachment to change them out or to get to the memory card ( I transfer pictures out of the camera to the PC because it's much faster) and when you opened the compartment, the batteries would fall out, the cover was hard to close and looked like it was going to fail too quickly. Also the lens cover was affixed to the body instead of the lens that comes out, so they had to make the latch really loose to keep from damaging the camera if you forgot to remove the lens cover before turning the camera on, you barely touch it and it comes off! Now It looks like I'm going to have to settle for a Panasonic FZ18 (it doesn't have a swivel LCD!)

I have owned Sony digital cameras before and this one is quite similar to those. The pictures have come out clear and the camera itself is easy to operate. There is one lingering question I have though, and as I am not very "tech-savvy" I may need some help from other owners of this camera! On the other models I have owned, you were able to digitally zoom into the picture and trim it. I have not been able to find the trim function on this camera. Does it even exist? In the other models you just zoomed into the picture and pressed menu and the trim option came up. If this trim function is not on this camera, it may be returned to the store because I need a camera that can do that! Besides that one little thing though, as I said, the pictures I have taken have turned out very nice and the camera itself is simple.

This camera is fairly simple to use.  However I have only had it 2 months and the shutter fails to open periodically.   I have to open it manually which I am afraid may damage the lens.     It's better than the polaroid digital I had before but I'm not totally happy with it.

This camera has received good reviews, but the one I ordered would not power up.  I'm starting the process of returning for another unit, and am awaiting a reply from the supplier (Electronics Expo).This is the 1st time I've purchased electronic equipment thru Amazon, and with the cost incurred with shipping the camera back to the supplier (not to mention wasted time), I'll have to rethink future purchases of this nature.

The biggest problem is that the LCD screen is  unreadable @ outdoors in daylight, so framing pictures under these conditions depends on good luck. Not having eye view as a option is very frustrating. The selection of night pictures scene is always blurry, may I need a tripod for that. However the selection of pictures with available light is very good.Battery life is good, I used it all day long in different set ups and the battery holds very well, do not forget to recharge it at the end of the day and will be ready for the next day. Xd cards are not available everywhere, and is more expensive than sd cards.I will buy it again if comes with a eye view option...

this camera can't be beat for the price, full featured, compact, weather resistant. My order got lost with UPS and AMAZON would not help me track it down or provide any support to resolve. I finally worked direct with vendor (Capital Electronics) and they immediately replaced it. No complaints with their service at all so why use a middleman when they offer no value.

I just bought this camera (red version) for my son's birthday. We used the batteries that came with it, they died right away. We have since put in at least 6 sets of new batteries, and they all have gone on to the big waste dump in the sky within an hour. Being that its been only two weeks, I am returning this piece of junk to the store from which it came this weekend, and giving my son the money to buy what he wants. My recommendation: Spend a little time looking for a better quality camera than this one. Pictures were good though, at least the ones we managed to take before it died.

I owned this one for a day and returned it, part of the reason is due to the retailer. I am looking for a medium resolution point-and-shoot camera using AA batteries. Every thing in the spec of Nikon L10/11/12 looks great and it did perform. It is slim enough to slip it into the pocket. What prompted the return is that it didn't focus exactly. After comparing with a 2MP camera and a 10MP DSLR, I am certain that the focusing of my L11 is not accurate. When I brought it back to Circuit City and said I want to look at other brand, they asked for a 15% re-stocking fee. I decided to take the lost and never go back to Circuit City! Even Ritz has a 10-day no-restocking period!At another store, I checked an L11 and found somewhat better result on focusing so perhaps I was just unlucky on the first unit.Another concern on these camera with large soft LCD panel is that it looks vulnerable to impact. The Sony or Canon models with hard plastic panel looks better. Canon is good that it uses normal size USB connector and has optical view finder but the Canon's are too bulky.I ended up with a Sony 650 even that means getting Memory Stick Pro Duo.

I was very upset when i opened this camera on Christmas. All I asked my mom for was a camera that was simple that i could take pictures with when I'm with my friends. I started using this camera and found that I couldn't see through the screen, everything was dark. The flash was just obnoxious and annoying and hurt people's eyes, and if you took a picture from a meter away of someone, the face was washed out from the flash. If you didn't use the flash the picture would be dark. I tried playing around with the settings, but nothing seemed to help.I never tried using the camera outside in the daylight, where I'm sure it would work better. Overall, I was very upset with the iZone 300

First of all, this S700 is not a bad camera. It does a lot for the money but before I bought this one I owned another finepix, the S5000 with Super CCD and the quality of the pictures are not comparable (even that S5000 it has only 3.1 Mega Pixels). Secondly, the body of the camera it doesn't feel "solid" but "plastic". So after a week of having this camera I decided to sell it and buy a Finepix S600Fd, what is a totally different product. My 2 cent advice is that with 100 dollars more (if you have) go for something that feels almost like a DSLR.check this link:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFWFY8">Fujifilm Finepix S6000fd 6.3MP Digital Camera with 10.7x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom with Picture Stabilization</a>this is a real incredible camera (S6000fd) for the price... one step before a DSLR!

This camera is virtually useless.  Not having a view finder is a real detriment.  I tried taking pictures while skiing and in the sun, the LCD screen is invisible.  You cannot see what you are taking.  I tried other shots outside with the same result.  I guess it's fine for taking inside shots, but I need a camera that does both.  So I bought a new camera that works.

This is by far the worst digital camera I've ever used. I would avoid this product like the plague if I could try again; I absolutely hate it.First major problem is battery life. It's awful. I was trying to take pictures in a cave I was exploring on vacation, and we went through 3 sets of batteries (that's 6 AA batteries) in just 30 minutes. One pair of brand new Energizer batteries, right out of the packaging, was actually dead in 7 minutes. This is inexcusable, and to add insult to injury you can't plug the camera in and recharge rechargeable batteries, so you either spend more on batteries than you do on the camera every time you go on vacation, or you lug around a battery charger with you everywhere you go.The battery life might be a little better if you turned off the digital view screen, but guess what? There is no optical view! You have no way of knowing what you're going to take a picture of with the digital view screen off.The pictures all come out looking like total crap, you may very well get a 6 megapixel image, but that's only the number of pixels in the image, it says nothing about the quality. Pictures are grainy, blurry, and noisy. You almost never get a picture looking the way it did in the viewscreen after you snap the shot. The autofocus is so bad, turning it on is like applying the Blur filter in photoshop to your picture, and the manual focus isn't much better either, particularly with such an inaccurate viewscreen. Pictures invariably come out with an intense yellow or orange tint when they looked fine in the viewscreen, and changing no settings, taking the same shot 5-6 times you'll finally come out with a picture that has the colors you see with your eyes.Because of the deplorable battery life, the camera will turn itself off after 3-4 minutes of inactivity, which would be a good feature, if it didn't take 30 seconds to boot up. The result: if you need to quickly turn the camera on and take a picture of something before you drive past it, or it stops happening, or any other situation where speed is a necessity, you completely miss the shot; but if you just keep the camera on in anticipation of taking the shot, the batteries will die almost instantly.Using it to record video sucks down power even faster than the already obscene rate the camera consumes batteries. Even worse, every time you zoom in or out the camera completely cuts off all audio recording. Immagine taking a tour of something really interesting, your tour guide is explaining some history or other details to you, you zoom in on what he's talking about to get a better look, and when you go to look at the video after your vacation, there is just silence as you were zooming in and out. Would you be angry? I sure am!My girlfriend has a 2.3 megapixel camera in her cell phone. Every single picture she took with it came out better than every picture I took with this camera, including inside a dark cave, where my flash should have drastically outperformed hers. At the end of the day, her cell phone still had power, where my camera had gone through 6 AA batteries in 30 minutes.Do not buy this cheap piece of junk, unless you see it on eBay of course, which is where I'll be trying to get rid of it. ;-)

I bought this thinking that with the li-ion battery and a backup, plus rain-resistant construction, it would be an ideal backpacking camera.  Wrong.  Its glossy, glare-ridden display screen is virtually impossible to use in moderate sunlight--and in Arizona, moderate sunlight is about as good as it gets--all you can see is reflection, even with field-expedient shades.  Battery life is mediocre if you have to use flash for fill or to deal with backlight, and auto exposure control seems incapable of taking decent pictures under high contrast.  Only upside is that it is genuinely rain-resistant.  But it is less capable than my daughter's 5 megapixel Nikon Coolpix, which takes better photos and has the advantage of running forever on 2 easily replaced lithium AA batteries.  This is my first and last Olympus....

Kodak easyshare cameras are the way to go with digital, in my opinion. Easy to use and all kodaks work the same. However, this model does not have a zoom! I purchased it, unknowingly, and discovered this fact when I got it home. Spend a few more bucks and get the C533!! I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my younger brother and I know he will love it.

I purchased this camera as a backup and potentially a replacement for my Fuji F450.  It is small, flashy and caught my eye as a handy little camera that would suffice for general point and shoot photography.First I read the Quick Start and installed the software in my iMac G5.  This should have been my clue as to what was ahead.  The software went in and a window came up that a software upgrade was available.  I clicked to update and the window it was downloading, but then Olympus Master froze necessitating a "Force Quit" of the Master Software.  I tried unsuccessfully at least four times to no avail.  Then I tried to send an email from the program.  Again, wrong.  Instead of opening my default email program, it opened the OSX Mail program.  I use Eudora 6.2 with all my other programs.Then on to the camra.  It was then that I discovered that in order to recharge the battery, you must remove it and place it in the charger.  My Fuji had a cradle to recharge and to download.  The Stylus 710  must have a USB cable connected to the camera, and to the computer in order to download to the computer.  That is after you realize you need a tool in order to open the little door to access the USB port.  I will be nice and not mention the xd card fits flush in its socket making it necessary to have a decent fingernail to push down to lock/unlock it.Now for the pictures:1)  The quality of the pictures in the "Auto" mode is primitive at best.  Probably OK for someone that doesn't take a  lot of pictures.  Undeer ideal conditions, good light and a quiet subject the picture would be acceptable.2)  In semi sunlight, cloudy in mid morning, the flash goes off for a normal picture.  Where is the auto ISO?  The pics were "OK" at best, being nice the Olympus.3)  DON'T plan on previewing photos taken outside in sunlight.  I couldn't see the LED screen - just hoped for the best.  (It does make a great mirror.)4)  Indoor flash were acceptable.5)  I took a number of photos under the same conditions within 20 minutes of each other on both cameras.  The Olympus lost in all cases.  It was like the "thrilling days of yesteryear" when you took your roll of film from your trusty Kodak Brownie and hoped for the best.Needless to say, the camera is going back.  I might caution anyone else looking for a "cute, simple" camera, this is for you.  Just don't plan on those "oooooh" pictures.  It would seem that most of the camera manufacturers have eliminated the eye view finder, the cradle, and ease of operation.  Even the new Fuji's have gone to the larger LED screen which is also lousy in bright sunlight.

I'll start this off by saying this is my first digital camera and I'm not an avid photographer.  However,I am puzzled by this camera.The controls are very easy to figure out, and using the camera is a breeze.  But the pictures don't turn out right.  Everything is way too vivid and unnatural looking.I've tried everything imaginable to fix this, since there are a ton of settings and modes to play around with and I've read the troubleshooting in the instruction book, but NONE of my pictures look natural.  That being said, since I'm not an avid photographer, maybe this is really good compared to other cameras, but it's not perfect.The video feature is great.  The sound is ok, and the picture on that looks better than the photographs.To summarize, the Pros are: Easy to figure out controls and pretty good video, and the Con is that it's been impossible to get a natural looking picture.

I'm a college student, and I got this as a Christmas gift from my girlfriend.  I REALLY wanted to like this camera, but it eventually HAD to be taken back.  I seriously thought it was just defective until I read some of these reviews.  I read a review where some guy thought it took great pictures of some snow and gave it a 5-star rating... well, duh.  Of course it takes good pictures of snow.  Snow is white, just like every picture this thing takes.  Every picture is at least somewhat blurry.  And besides the blurriness, every picture is either too dark or too bright.  I read some reviews that were defending this camera that say the pictures look fine if taken between 6 and 9 feet.  Oh great.  That's useful.  Because no one ever wants to take a picture outside that range???  You have to have EXTREMELY low expectations to think that this camera takes decent pictures.  Besides the low picture quality, the fact the camera doesn't allow you to use AA batteries is a bad thing in my mind.  What if you're on a trip and you don't have access to an outlet to charge it?  It'd be nice to just have an extra pair of lithium AA's.  Plus.. rechargeable batteries eventually no longer hold a charge.  After a year, the internal battery, when maximum charged will probably only be able to take a dozen pictures before the battery is spent.  This is just a simple fact of rechargeable batteries.  That's why laptop makers provide a maximum of 1 year warranty on their batteries.  Also, the thing won't stop beeping!  With every click of a button, the thing makes this annoying beep.  You go to the settings to mute the beep, but when you restart the camera, the settings are reset and back comes the beep!  And it takes about 8 clicks to get to the mute setting... So, say you're at a wedding and you want to take a picture.. all of a sudden.. BEEP... BEEP.. You may kiss the.. BEEP... c'mon Polaroid.  I guess the picture wouldn't turn out unless your 6 to 9 feet away anyway...One last bad thing about this camera.  On any other LCD display I've used... even on my cheap camera phone.. when you're in a dark environment, the lcd display automatically adjusts to be brighter so you can see what you're taking a picture of.  When the environment is bright, the lcd adjusts to be dimmer.  This display doesn't change!  If you're even in a simple dim living room, you can't see anything on the display!  That is just ridiculous.  Overall, I feel this camera is a piece of junk.  It looks cool, size is perfect, it could be pretty convenient if it worked, but the purpose of a camera is to take pictures.  This 'camera' does that VERY poorly... therefore, this is a poor camera.  Buy it if you enjoy disappointment.

This camera finally has a 2.5" quality LCD.  It's about time.  For former models (S2, S3), the LCD is too small.  To frame a picture on those models it was "point and pray" because it was hard to see what one was framing.With the 2.5" rotating display, this has changed.  The LCD is now very usable, and it significantly improves the whole experience of this camera.The movie feature is great.  The interface to start a movie -- a dedicated button -- is great.  Other functions are very easy to get to quickly.I took a video of fireworks, and it turned out great.  I tested the ultra-zoom and image stabilization with the improvement to 8mp, and it's significantly better than the prior model (S3 IS).The camera finally has a lens cap that attaches to the camera rather than just a piece of plastic that loosely covered the lens.With all these positive changes, it's very alarming that Canon moved the SD card slot to where the batteries are, instead of a separate slot by itself in former models.  This is a horrible design -- that is a weak link in the camera that is bound to break.So, I foresee needing to replace this camera when that door inevitably breaks.  If I take many pictures frequently, and want to move them from the SD card to the computer, I have to open the battery compartment each time.  That could be 10-20 extra opens / a busy week of photos.If the door breaks, then the camera is useless, or, possibly I could use two sets of rubber bands on the camera, but they would have to exert a lot of pressure.Other than that glaring design flaw, the camera is excellent.Update:  I purchased the AC adapter (for about $50) which enables me to load the photos to the PC directly through the USB connection without having to open up the battery compartment.  Moving the SD card to the battery compartment continues to be a source of frustration and is the weak spot in this camera that will almost certainly be the first part to break.

If I had realized how grainy and so much like the original digital cameras from the late 90s this was, I would never have purchased it. I based my decision to buy on the price and the reviews, but this camera is not suitable for anything more than a child. The pictures remind me of the square first digital cameras that came out and the grain is like the Disc cameras from the 1980s. NOT a good purchase. Pay a tiny bit more and get a Sony or another model than this one for an outstanding picture.

After having to replace my cannon because of being damage due to being dropped, I had wanted to get the same, but it was no longer available, so after researching and looking at reviews, I decided on the Sony cyber shot.  I was immediately dissapointed.  It uses regular batteries, it comes with no charger,  it doesnt take standard memory cards, it is very UN-user friendly.  I took it to my sons school concert to take pictures and they all came out blurry, it is very difficult to use and the quality of pictures is poor.  I ended up reselling the product and went with a Casio Exilim which I am very happy with and its very easy to use with great quality pictures.  Dont waste your money on the Sony,Sony has great electronics but I wouldnt say that for their cameras.

This was my 5th digital camera, second by Fuji.  Trying to be as polite as possible, but sometimes you need to call a spade a spade.  Comparing it against the other cameras I have had, it is the worst camera I have ever pushed the shutter button down on.  For a point and shoot camera it's the worst.  Take a look at the images I posted and form your own opinion.  These were the first images taken with this camera on auto mode.  I bought it today and it's going back tomorrow.  My Fuji E550 is a far better camera than this one.  Perhaps you might look at it or a newer E model.  I also own an Olympus C2100, it's an old 2.1mil megapixel camera with a 10 power zoom with stabilizer and it far outperforms this camera.

I bought this camera because of the small size and the weather proof.  My  wife was asking for a smaller camera and we decided on the 710.  Pictures are great in the daytime and outdoors and even in small indoor with flash.The problems started when we noticed that we keep running out of batteries.  This turned out to be because when you connect the camera to the computer via USB the camera use internal battery instead of using the power from the USB.  So you have to connect it and get the pictures then get it out as quickly as you can before teh batteries die.  2nd problem is with the flash.  The pictures indoors are dark so you have to use flash.  the flash does not have a good range.  I'm not talking about 100 feet but more like 20 feet.  Probably 10 feet is the max for this flash.  If you try to use the "available light" feature then the shutter stay open for longer time which makes it impossible to take a good the picture without being effected by the hand shaking or the subject moving.  Other than that,  the camera is great and I'll probably keep it for taking pictures outdoors.

DO NOT buy Canon products unless the terms offer a full refund.  "My" SD 1000 arrived malfunctioning.  I could have returned it for another one, but I've played that hand already.  After another sample of a bad batch I end up changing manufacturers while losing weeks of my life.  So I promptly delivered it to the only U.S. Canon Factory Service Center, after being told they average a 9 day turn.  23 days later (long past the vacation I bought it for) I called and was told they were still waiting for parts.  After burrowing deep in their system (you can't get there from here) I found a rep that actually called the FSC while I held, was told they DID have the part (the whole PCB), made it top priority and had it repaired by the next morning.  I then called the FSC and was told I could pick it up.  When I arrived the counter girl told me they were supposed to call me for pickup.  (When, in another month?)  I only see poor quality control and shoddy service from Canon.  If you want to pay for something you cannot use, to have your concerned emails "forwarded" to Canon USA (and apparently deleted), and to spend hours on the phone, this is the place.

First of all the pictures do not have a high quality. I don't really care since I am just having fun with it. But what really bothers me is that the videos are super blurry. It takes a long time to focus and that's difficult to work with when you are trying to record.I wish I would have choose a better camera.

I bought this camera about two and a half weeks ago because I was looking for something more compact than the one I have. One of my favorite features of digital cameras is the video recording and playback. What I didn't realize (and found to be misleading) is that the sound is only audible when played back on TV or computer. When it says "record with sound" I (naively?) assumed that it meant on playback. Unfortunately, it is 3 days past the return date at Best Buy or I would take it back. Looks like I might try selling it here.Another disadvantage that I wasn't accustomed to with my old camera is the rate at which the Sony Cybershot sucks up battery power. I bought brand new Energizer rechargable batteries when I bought the camera and it wouldn't even accept those without being charged first- right out of the package!So in a nutshell, I'm a little disappointed.

My son received this camera as a gift and he brought it along on vacation but he has been very disappointed by it. The picture quality is terrible. My Kodak DX6490 is only 4mp (compared to this Samsung's 6mp) and the picture quality is so much better. The shot looks fine on the camera's screen...until you upload it to your computer and see what it really looks like. Grainy, blurry and "pixelated" shots are what you get.No view finder makes it hard to see what you're aiming at when outdoors. The worst feature about this camera is the way it wastes batteries. They have to be replaced about every 30 minutes. Also, there is no warning about "low battery." It just shuts down and dies.If you rarely take pictures, you may be satisfied with this poor quality product for the price (although you'll spend more in batteries than on the camera itself.) If you care about taking beautiful pictures to preserve memories of trips, events, etc. then I suggest you skip this piece of junk...

I got this camera for my kids for Xmas. We used it often. It was taking pictures fine outside or in a sunny room. But any other pictures taken were dark. I couldn't even find the target. I had to follow the lamp in the living room and move the camera down to floor where our dog is because the view window was black. Only the light stood out. I read all the directions one by one exactly as it said and it still takes crapy pictures. When you put the flash on the pictures come out when you look at them white. So bad you can't even see what the picture is. I tried taking a pictures of my sisters bridal shower today and now the pictures are coming out red. The cake came out with a flash all white. Nobody knew what it was. We thought for our first digital camera we wouldn't spend to much. It was small. You didn't need batteries. It had a charger. But I'm sending it back. I thought maybe it'd fix itself. So much for that. I wouldnt buy one.

I was looking for an expensive but quality digital snapshooter.  I had a Coolpix 2100 (2.1 megapixel) stolen during RAGBRAI.  I thought the 6 megapixel L11 would be an upgrade.  Unfortunately, I liked my 2MP better for the following reasons:*viewfinder*ability to trim video directly on the camera.  Video on the L11 records as .mov files, which cannot be trimmed on the camera OR on a PC without buying QuickTime Pro or some conversion software, but who wants to do that if you're only paying $120 for a camera?  My 2MP did a great job, albiet with poorer video quality.  I'm not planning on showing my little videos on the big screen however.*Picture quality.  The L11 flash washed everything out on inside pictures.  Really white and blue, no true colors.  I messed with the settings a bit, but again, who wants to do that on a point and shoot?  I want anybody to be able to pick this up and take a decent snapshot.  Outdoor, suny day pictures were not bright enough, even after shutting down the exposure by a couple of stops.  The 2MP took more pleasing pictures, but again, I'm not blowing them up to poster size.I ended up bringing it back to Circuit City after 4 days.  They waived the restocking fee because I asked them to (would've been $20).  I exchanged it for the Canon A550, a 7 MP camera for $10 more.  I am very pleased with that camera, and would not recommend the L11.  Sorry Nikon.

While I was looking for a new camera, I wanted to try and not only get a brand I had heard of, but also a brand that would be backed by a great product. This camera is not only compact, but it's pictures' are clear and practically un-flawed. The settings on the camera really do help with whatever you're taking pictures of, and sometimes it seems as though the picture is postcard perfect. The shutter speed is a little slower than what I'm used to, but for the total quality of the pictures, it's fine with me. This camera is a great buy and a great product.

This camera offers a lot of features, it is small enough but you do not have a feeling that it will just drop from your hand. The issue I have with it - too long time between two shots. Unless I miss some settings, it takes too long for another shot.

I bought this camera for my mom for Christmas.  She is finally using it, but has found that it does not take good pictures when it is slightly dark.  Even inside in a fairly lit room, the pictures are not as good as I would expect.  I'm going to see if there is another camera that works with the dock, cause the prints turn out nice when the pic is well lit.  I'll just upgrade the camera (I hope!)

We have a really nice $400 Kodak digital camera that my husband bought for work.  It holds hundreds of photos and they are crystal clear.  This camera is definitely not that. We bought this for my daughter's 10th birthday; it is fine for what she wants to do, though she thought the photos were not very sharp when she viewed them on the computer. Also, she has trouble getting the photos to be light enough, even though they look fine through the viewer. It only holds 16 photos and some more in favorites, but 16 is not enough for a vacation.  We will look into adding memory.  She likes her camera, and again, it is fine for a young person who just wants to snap photos of her friends or a family trip.

[ Revised July 14th. I would now rate this camera at 2 stars given other cameras have had price drops, making them relatively much better. ]This is the 5th digital camera I've owned and the one I've found to be the most "lacking." If you are simply looking for a point/shoot with no additional features and okay pictures (why a 7 MP then?), this will work. However, I was looking for something that was a little more than point/shoot (ie, some basic control features which seem to be the baseline of Canon cameras). I would rather take pictures with my previous Canon A85 (4 MP but better quality images).Pros: - 7.2 MP (although I think this is kind of silly... the number of pixels may be high but a 4 MP camera with higher quality would produce better pictures/prints) - mostly easy to navigate around the menus (just not much to navigate) - small/compact - cheap (price), although now the same price as cameras with significantly more featuresCons: - no viewfinder, which is a pain when it is sunny - pictures are mediocre - colors aren't as vibrant as I hoped they'd be - many of the pictures are grainy, even in full sunlight - battery/memory card door opens very easily (too easily... opens up accidentally a lot) - lens distortion is pretty bad and makes panoramas a bust - only advantage over other introductory digital cameras is the sizeI hesitate to recommend this camera to anyone, however, if you are simply looking for a digital camera with ONLY point and shoot options AND that is compact, this will probably work out. Sony is looking for that niche with this camera. If you want a few more options besides point/shoot, look elsewhere.The quality isn't that of Canon -- the only advantage of this camera over a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MFA1NE">Canon A550</a> is that it is smaller. This camera and the Canon are, as of the review revision, the same price plus/minus a couple bucks. Advantages of the Canon include -  creative flexibility (ie, opportunities to become a better photographer and take better pictures via mild manipulation of camera settings) - 4x optical zoom relative to the 3x of the Sony - includes a view finder (no longer standard on point and shoot cameras) - superior software, including "Photostitch" (phenomenal for making panoramas) - allows for easy point/shoot on top of the features listed above (ie, ease of use for a point/shoot is comparable with the Sony)Having owned 3 Canon A-series cameras, I would not hesitate to recommend them. They range from the price of this camera up to a few hundred for additional features/resolution... if I was buying one now I would probably just go with the A550 since 7MP and 4x optical zoom is more than enough for a point/shoot. If you have money to blow on additional features beyond what the A550 offers than I don't know why you are even considering this camera :) Other camera brands may also be good, although I am not very familiar with their offerings... I looked around briefly for some comparable cameras and I only found one non-Canon that I would consider if I was again in the market for a point/shoot: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MW8GVQ">Panasonic Lumix DMC-LS70S</a>.

This camera sucks, thats all i can say about it. One thing not mentioned before, you have to be super still to take a clear picture, otherwise the slightest shake will produce the worst distortion of your face ever.

Most pictures are blurred, the camera is very sensitive to shake/vibration.  Also most indoor photos are too dark/dim even with flash. The color calibartion is poor too.  Don't spend money on this product. It was bought for one of my teens and she would not accept it.  It was replaced with a canon that was 100 times better.

We have been long-time Olympus customers when it comes to digital cameras.  Our first was the D490.  Our second was the Stylus 400.  On the strength of our previous purchases, we did not hesitate to get the 710.  We have been extremely disappointed.  Just about every picture we have taken (at the highest quality setting) have been blurry and far below the picture quality of the 4 megapixel camera we used previously.  We sent the 710 back to Olympus because we were convinced this was a problem with our camera.  Olympus wasn't particularly interested to hear that we were loyal customers, said it replaced the lens, and we saw absolutely no difference when we received the camera back.  Unfortunately, we have now taken 6-months-worth of very average-quality family pictures. We will buy a Cannon or Sony in the next week.  Sorry, Olympus, but you have now lost us forever.

As some have said in their reviews the camera dies way too quickly. I don't know whether this was just with my camera but sometimes when I would take pictures the LCD screen would turn green and I would have to turn the camera off and back on again. Even in a lit room the LCD screen would be seemingly dark. The only way I could actually be able to view something so that I know whether or not I am getting a good snapshot of a picture is if I am outside in the bright sunlight. My camera is now broken because somehow the LCD screen has a crack on the inside of it which I don't see how this could have happened seeing as how I never really took my camera anywhere. When I called Polaroid to see if it could be fixed they gave me no information whatsoever. They only repeated back to me the obvious, which was that it was, well of course, cracked on the inside. Luckily I got the camera as Christmas gift though I believe my father only bought it because it was cheap camera.

I was excited to finally own a CANON. However my 4 yr. old Sony 3.2 megapixels Cyber-shot has features that I'm not finding on the CANON. Such as the date stamp, zooming and trimming a picture before downloading. As I understand it, you can't zoom when you're in "postcard" setting before taking a picture. Altho there's a good possibility I don't understand the instruction book. That happens a lot.

My employer provided me with the older A 530 model. It's OK, but the lens has VERY noticeable barrel distortion at the wide end, enough to ruin shots that show buildings or anything else with straight lines (like the ocean horizon). If the 560 has the same lens (and the numbers look the same), then I can't recommend it, even at the price. I hope others will tell me that the newer models have fixed this problem.

This is a good camera but it still takes regular batteries instead of being able to plug in and be recharged.  This can be a pain on a trip as you will have to also either pack extra batteries or a battery charger for rechargeable ones.  It is also a bit heavy because of the batteries.  Still a good deal but something you may want to know.

this camera takes fairly good pictures in terms of the clarity and the sharpness. The size is also convenient compact. When I zoom in for the fine print, the details come out fairly well. The menu and the tool bars are not the easiest to navigate, however, and the buttons can be very confusing to use.

I bought this for my mom for Mother's Day and I'm disappointed.  The picture quality just isn't there, all the pictures feel a little flat.  Not blurry, per se, just never crisp.  That being the primary function of a camera, I can't get too up on this thing.  I have a 5 year old Nikon Coolpix 2100 that I paid the same price for back then (87 bucks on sale) that takes better photos than this.  Cheap optics on this camera, I suppose.The battery life seems to be fairly limited as well and the response time seems a tad slow.  If an inanimate object could have malaise, this camera would.Everything works, and nothing's bad enough to make me feel ripped off, but by no means is this little thing impressive, certainly not as great as what some of the other reviewers have made it out to be.  It is what it is, I suppose, but I'm still a little bummed.

The Kodak 530 is not as clear as I expected.  The picture does not have the clarity that my Kodak CX4200 have which is only 3 megapixels.  The CD that places the Easy Share program on my computer picks the 530 up as a 315.  Nothing in the camera references the camera as being  a 530.  530 is printed on the outside of the camera only.I loved the Kodak CX4200 which was lost at a reunion (3 megapixels), so I thought the 530 would be a better camera with 5 megapixels but not so.) I really can't be sure the camera is 530 since the computer reads it as a 315.

The A550 is the same mehanical design as the rest of the series. I had a Canon A540 that worked fine for 10 months then for no apparant reason the lens did not retract. This is known problem with Canon cameras (do a web search to find lots of instances). I returned the camera to Canon since it is still under warrantee. They claimed that it had impact damage - which it did not - and wanted $103 to fix it. I will NEVER BUY a CANON camera again. I had the same problem with a Canon A20 a few years ago but that was out of warrantee.

Is it me or has the QUALITY of these digital cameras gone downhill?  I am the owner of a VERY old Fuji 5MP camera (when 5MP were $400) and the image quality of the photos that Fuji takes is way better than this one boasting 7MP!! Also, I keep hearing how clear the LCD is, but on mine it has noise! Sure it is a large screen for the camera size, but the noise detracts alot from the image.  On my old Fuji, the screen is flawless.  I dont get it.  Didi I get a defective cam or does every model contain the LCD noise that I speak of?  Other than that, it seems to work fine and for $130 bucks, I guess a 7MP cam is pretty darn good despite the noisy LCD screen.

I just bought this camera and was disappointed.  My other nikon had 3.2 megapixels and it took better pictures than this one.  I'm not sure what's wrong with it but it takes fuzzy pictures for some reason.  The price is right but the quality isn't.  I'm going to return it and pay a little bit more for a better quality nikon.

I bought this camera and loved the look of it, the feel of it, the photos, the size . . . all until, within 2 weeks of buying it and without anything at all happening to the camera to provoke this problem, the lens stopped opening.   I would turn on the camera, it would start up but the lens cover would not open.  I would turn it off and turn it on again and it would sometimes open the second time and sometimes not.   I loved the camera so much I thought I'd give it a day to "sort itself out," but it just got worse.   So, I'm sending it back and going to try to find a suitable replacement for what the camera was before it broke.

I purchased the Kodak C310 and Printer Dock and the camera would not immediately charge when taken out of the box.  We contacted Kodak and they said we had to return the camera and printer dock back to the dealer.  I had to pay all shipping and handling costs and Kodak said it was their policy not to refund the return of defective equipment to the customer.  This camera costs me additional $20 because Kodak does not accept responsiblity for selling defective equipment.  I could have bought a more expensive camera for the additional expense it cost me for buying a Kodak camera.

These PowerShot "A" cameras are Canon's attempt to deliver the quality and features of its more expensive PowerShot "G" and PowerShot Pro "S" lines (such as full zoom lenses) at a budget price. The results, though, are a mixed bag. The entry-level A460 is lousy, but the rest of the line gives you a lot for the money. (How do I know all this? Because I've actually gotten to use all of these cameras. I earn my living shooting photos at Walt Disney World for a travel guidebook, and nearly every day guests ask me to take photos of them with their own cameras, which most often are Canon PowerShots.)Here's my opinion of the "A" series line:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MF4Z4A">Canon PowerShot A460 5.0MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom (Silver)</a> Yuck! This 5MP camera is like a relic from five years ago: the simple but poorly designed controls -- a little joy pad surrounded by four buttons -- make it far too easy to do things like change the zoom setting when you set the flash. I have fat fingers and I mess things up almost every time! Also, I've seen photos taken with this camera, and they often have that purple fringe around their highlights, which are typically blown out. On the plus side, the camera does have an optical viewfinder. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMU4HS">Canon PowerShot A540 6MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom</a> RECOMMENDED. Looking for a good bargain camera? Take a look at this one. It's a 2006 model, but it works just fine. You get 20 shooting modes, a full set of manual controls and can record low-res sound video at 60 frames per second. Before you buy it, however, check Amazon's price of the better, and newer, A560. It may be cheaper.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MFA1NE">Canon PowerShot A550 7.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom</a>This basic camera isn't that bad, but there's no reason to buy it. For about $25 more you can step up to the PowerShot A560 (see below), which has the same body, sensor and lens but Canon's much better Digic III processor. Buy this one and, yes, you'll save a few bucks, but your photos won't look as good.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NK3NBA">Canon PowerShot A560 7.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom</a>RECOMMENDED. Here is a nice camera! Featuring Canon's acclaimed Digic III processor, it includes the company's face-detection metering system and a decent red-eye removal. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NK3H4S">Canon PowerShot A570IS 7.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom</a>RECOMMENDED. Same as the A560 but with optical image stabilization and the ability to shoot manually. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HAOVC6">Canon PowerShot A630 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom</a>RECOMMENDED. You can do a lot with this sweet little camera. It has a flip-out LCD panel and lots of manual controls. The shots I've seen from this model look great. Keep your ISO under 800 and you won't get any noise.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HARTYI">Canon PowerShot A640 10MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom</a>Same as the A630 except 10MP.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HATNH4">Canon PowerShot A710 IS 7.1MP Digital Camera with 6x Image-Stabilized Optical Zoom</a>RECOMMENDED. This fully-loaded model has all the toys, including a full-range zoom (35mm film equivalent of 35-210mm), adjustable flash power and optional second-curtain flash. This last features means you can make the flash fire at the end of a long exposure, instead of the beginning, so moving subjects streak into focus instead of out. Much more for your money than the A640.By Mike Neal, author of The Complete Guide to Walt Disney World.

This is a good camera. the only problem I have with it is that the video doesnt take sound and that isnt something the site specifies. It also eats batteries.

Pictures were grainy.  Zoom was pathetic.  All the camera seemed to have going for it was the compact size and its all weather advantage.  Returned camera b/c of the overall disappointment.

SAve your money. This camera is very disapointing and i do not recommend it for purchase.  I have had 35 mm olympus and loved it but this is not up to their standards.  You can may inside pictures that turn out fairly well but it is usless outside.  The nice big viewing area on the back just goes completly black even in low light outdoors so you cannot see what you are shooting.  I will be replacing this camera as soon as possible.

I have purchased two other Olympus Stylus digital cameras and feel like the guy who keeps hitting his thumb with a hammer and wondering why in Hell do I keep on doing this?Well, I guess because they are almost indestructible and are water resistant, but I still wish they were intuitive and easier to understand.My Stylus 400 has served me well, but with a small LCD display it was impossible to judge my pictures until I uploaded them to a PC, so the display was pretty worthless. When working outdoors in bright light the LCD display was impossible to see, but it was still possible to use the optical viewer to frame my photos.Okay! So I saw all of the bright LCD displays on newer cameras last year and decided to take the plunge and get something with a larger screen.  So here I am with a Stylus 710, still weather resistant, but without an optical view finder and still a poor LCD screen that can't be seen in even moderate outdoor light.I have seen other cameras that have bright, clear LCD displays and wonder why Olympus can't match their quality?If you want a camera that is stuck in the technology of 2001, go ahead and try the Olympus, but there are certainly better ones available.

I've used a Canon G3 for about 4 years, and have always been pleased with the image quality. I've tested the A460 against it in several situations and can report that:-it's faster - the powerup and shot to shot speed are excellent.-it's easy to learn and use.-it focuses better and quicker in macro mode.-The flash works well and quickly, and creates reasonably pleasing light in a variety of circumstances.-The images in sunlight or reasonably bright cloudy circumstances are fine.BUT - the images at lower light, without flash, are unusably noisy - a major drawback for me as my intended use is to take a small light camera with me on my evening walks and jogs. If low-light photos aren't important to you, it's a fine choice.

Bad to poor product shipping service.I placed an order for a Canon A550 camera on May 28, 2007 taking advantage of the "free shipping", but as of Today Monday, June 4, 2007 the product has not shipped; however be careful of the Amazon product ads that guided my decision to buy: this product was stock and would be shipped quickly because if I would have paid the shipping cost I could have received it in 3- or 4-days.From-now-on, I am careful what the Amazon product ads say, because it might be too good to be the truth.

I was disgusted when this camera stopped working after only 1 week. I bought the A560 to take on vacation, and kept it well-stored in a padded case. With less than 200 shots, the lens cover stopped opening/closing, and then the view screen died. (You could still preview a shot in movie mode, but not in camera mode, and you could still review stored pics - very strange.) The AA batteries tend to last only about 75 pictures, by the way, so keep plenty on hand. I had bought a Canon this time because neither of my Kodaks had held up more than one year, but I returned this and bought a Kodak Z712 instead.

I'm not sure what happened, but the mechanism that extends and retracts the lens broke a few weeks after I bought the camera.  Now I have to mail it to Canon and wait to see if I have to pay to get it fixed.

There are some things that Nikon did right with this camera, but mostly they  got it wrong.  Although I love my Nikon Coolpix 3100 (3 megapixels), some may want to avoid the Nikon Coolpix L11.First, the good.  It takes great pictures and fits into your pocket. OK for snapshots under normal conditions.  I also have had some professional quality pics with good color saturation then the light is good.  The camera remembers your settings (eg, exposure compensation) after being turned off, meaning you don't need to reset them each time you power up/down.Now the bad:1.	As one reviewer noted, it does not have a viewfinder, only an LCD monitor.  First, powering the LCD screen makes it eat batteries.  Next, the LCD screen is useless in bright light because you can't see what's on the screen.2.	Once the camera alerts you that it's turning off after a certain period of non-use (eg, 60 seconds), it takes a long time to actually turn off.  And in the meantime, there's nothing you can do to stop it from turning off.  Not good it you want to get that great shot.3.	The cycling time between pics is very long.  It takes about 1.5 - 2 seconds to recycle and get ready for the next shot.  4.	The "multi-selector" (the large round dial in the back that lets you select flash, timer, exposure, and macro settings) is prone to operator error (meaning it's too small and you will select the wrong setting a lot (eg, exposure instead of timer).  This means you need to scroll out of the wrong setting, back into the correct setting.  Again, a time waster.5.     It can be very noisy (the pictures look grainy) in night pics.The price isn't bad for 6 megapixles, but I suspect the low price is indicative of how much some people don't like this camera.  Still, I think it's a three star.

I really expected more out of this camera for the price. I am not happy with the quality of the pictures or the automatic focus on the device. I do not recommend this product.

Somehow we lost our Canon A70 after 4 years of flawless service.  This A550 seemed like an incredible replacement with many more features at a fraction of what we paid for the A70 in 2003.  But the first time I turned it on the lens cover didn't open fully.  I turned it on and off 50 times but it got stuck the same way every time.  It's noticeably misaligned.  In fact, the craftsmanship of the whole camera seems to be a big step below the A70.  It has a lot of features for the money, but we have serious concerns about the quality.We returned it ... not sure what to get now.

I work at a retail store that sells the Samsung S630, and I have yet to see any other model or brand that customers have had as much trouble with than this one (to the point that we took it off the shelves). Pictures look grainy and the quality is certainly lacking, but its major flaw is the poor manufacturing and reliability. After putting in a fresh set of AA batteries, the camera may take 2-25 pictures on average before depleting them completely. This has been the most prevalent complaint I've received, and I've done it myself. Also, the extending lens can be problematic and stay extended when the batteries die. Some of our customers have sent the camera to Samsung multiple times only to get it back and have it still 'broken'. If you have to buy this camera, buy a warranty with it, but it probably won't be long before you return it or redeem the warranty.

This is the first digital camera I have purchased.  It never occured to me that a camera would not have a "regular" viewfinder.  When I noticed it didn't, I figured it didn't matter because of the electronic display.  Then I tried to film a model airplane.  What a PAIN!!  I couldn't believe how stupidly engineered this camera is.  How can anyone film/take a pic on a sunny day when all I see in the display is myself!!!  I am very frustrated with this aspect of the camera.  Didn't anyone at Sony try to take a picture/video outdoors????

Maybe if this thing was designed to be a play-toy for preschoolers it might be okay.  Read the review by Regular College Kid and it is completely accurate.  Some people wrote a good review for this camera, but you must remember - there are a lot of not-very-smart people in this world.  I was especially surprised by the reviewer who wrote that the washed out colors and blurriness were "artistic".  Nobody wants a camera that has washed out colors and blurriness! Any room short of something really well lit will result in a black display on the LCD.  You can refer to Regular College Kid's review for all the info you need to know.  Luckily this camera was free.  I think i will use it for target practice or run over it with my car, just to avoid passing it on and frustrating another user.

This camera takes HORRIBLE pictures. The flash produces very uneven lighting, with a very obvious shadow around the edge of pictures. In normal indoor lighting situations with the flash off (to eliminate the shadows), the pictures are very noisy/grainy. I have a webcam that takes better still pictures than this camera. Avoid this camera at all costs! Spend another $50-80 for a Canon A540 (6 megapixel) if you want a simple point-and-shoot camera that takes awesome pictures. The only good thing about this Kodak is that it's easy to use, which should be expected given the lack of features on this camera.

I HATE this camera, and have had nothing but problems with it since it was given to me as a mother's day gift in May, 2007. I have sent it in for service (what a frustrating two weeks!)and after getting it back--allegedly fixed-- I opened the box, and the batteries I had put in just prior to sending it for service were not working. I put in two more brand new batteries and one day later, yesterday, I power it on and get the "low battery" message. The lag time between pushing the button and the actual picture snap is infuriating, and the service provided by Samsung was abominable. I will never purchase another Samsung item! I am beyond frustrated-- the camera's shortcomings were exacerbated by the complete lack of service provided by Samsung' so-called "service" center. I was unable to reach anyone in a position of authority, and the phone rep actually refused to let me speak to a supervisor, and refused to give me a supervisor's name. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA, and DO NOT GIVE THIS unresponsive company your business!

I owned 3 Canon digital cameras before purchasing the SD750.  I bought this one originally because I needed another Canon to replace my old Canon (5.0 megapixels).  I took the SD750 on my 2 wks vacation and 80% of the photos I took came out blurry once you view them up close and download them onto the computer.  Even though I love the slim modern design and the HUGE 3" screen, but it does NOT have a good stabilizer.  I view myself as a decent photographer since I used my other 3 (old) Canons for years and the photos ALWAYS come out very clear and sharp.  That's the MAIN reason why I stuck with Canon for so long.  (I hate Sony digital camera anyway but that's another story.)  But the SD750 was such a disappointment!!  Maybe the one I got was defective but BestBuy (where I purchase the camera from) tested it out and said it was fine.  So I ended up returning the SD750 and bought the SD850 (8.0 megapixels).  Even though it's $100 more than the SD750, but the SD850 comes with the image stabilizer.  I figure more money equals higher quality and I was right.  The SD850 is flawless!!!  I highly recommend the SD850 instead!!

This is supposed to be a top-of-the-line pocket camera. Unfortunately it is badly in need of image stabilization. Outside pix are great, but inside there is no way to take without the flash or a tripod. Everything else is fuzzy. In addition, for some reason does not allow you to copy _TO_ the camera, using it as a USB-storage device. Otherwise is great little camera.

I have been a professional photographer for 40+ years, and over the past 6 years have stayed with the Canon line of Digital cameras. I had been looking for another compact camera to keep in the car, and could not resist the price of the new Fuji Finepix S700 at $214.00 (plus a free 2GB disk). All of the reviews had been great, so thought I would give one a try. Well, I received mine a few days ago, and what a disappointment. I loved the big clear LCD screen, and the eye level view-finder worked great also.  But I had a big problem with the auto focus. I finally just sat in my office and took photos of my book case over and over. A few would be a OK, but most would be way out of focus.  I sold my little Canon S2 IS yesterday (after receiving the Fuji from Amazon), and in my experience it was a far better camera. The only draw back for me was the tiny view-finder, the very small LCD screen, and the ISO 400 limitation. To bad Canon did not address these issues with the new S3 IS. One thing for sure though, Amazon was absolutely great with the return...it was breeze. I boxed it back up, and it's all ready to go back in the AM. Maybe I just got a bad one, maybe one made on a Monday? I was pleased, however, to see that Amazon was also offering the Canon SD800 IS today for only $172.00. I always wanted a pocket camera, so now I have one on the way. Hope I have better luck this time,

I just upgraded from a Canon S1 IS to the Canon S5 IS, and got absolutely HORRIBLE "soft" images from pictures taken in "AUTO" mode indoors at highest quality (both with and without flash) with this camera. I got FAR sharper images from my Canon S1 IS. I am shocked and terribly disappointed.

I bought this camera after having a Casio Exilim EX-P600 because I wanted something smaller, and liked that it had image stabilization and was weather resistant (important for camping, etc).  However, in comparison with my previous Casio Exilim, I have been extremely disappointed with the picture quality - except for outside in bright, indirect light, a good 2/3 of the pictures are blurry and/or incredibly grainy.  While its size means that I almost always have this camera with me, I am frustrated and disappointed every time I load the pictures onto my computer.

I had this camera about a week. The screen broke. Olympus warranty would not cover it. The way the camera is shaped it makes breakage at the right side of the screen a probability. I went to two Best Buy stores in Raleigh North Carolina and Orlando. Both store demo units had screens broken in the same area. I wanted to buy the same camera as I had a battery, memory card, etc. I did not by another Olympus 710.

I recently bought this camera as a replacement for an older 2.1mp Canon PowerShot S100. I own a great  digital SLR, but my wife and I like to have a simple point+shoot for short trips, easy carrying, etc. My older Canon was fine, this new SD1000 is not. I'm going to give it another few days (max), but I'm quite close to returning it.Why? The *one thing* this camera is supposed to do well is take photos in automatic mode. I don't want to mess with camera settings - for that, I take my SLR and fiddle to my heart's content. With a point+shoot, you're supposed to do just that: point and shoot.The basic problem I've observed (after ~500 photos) is the auto-focus is *terrible*. I tried different lighting scenarios: indoor (flash), indoor (no flash), outdoor (daylight+flash), outdoor (daylight, no flash). The results were the same: approximately half of the photos turned out poorly, and almost always it was due to the autofocus.For example, I took a photo of a subject positioned directly in front of the camera, directly in the middle of the viewfinder, about 3 feet away. The subject took up approximately 40% of the view, and again, was positioned directly in front of the camera. Instead of doing what you think autofocus would do, the camera somehow decided to focus on the background scene, completely blurring the foreground. If I checked the photo on the camera, it looked fine but that's only because you cannot perceive focus problems on a 2" lcd screen. Once I transferred the photo to my computer, it was immediately evident that the focus was completely wrong and the photo was unusable.This autofocus blurring happened repeatedly, in varying light conditions, and is flat out terrible. I still have my Canon S100, and despite being an older, slower, and much lower resolution camera (2.1 vs. 7.1 megapixels), I'm tempted to keep using it instead.

I am so disappointed with this camera, most of the pictures are grainy, especially inside pictures. Trying to return it to sony but first have to mail it to their repair center.

I bought this camera beginning of this year as the older Olympus 3.2 MP camera was very good. However, this one just frustrates me since you cannot see the image you are taking on the LCD when shooting outdoors. Bought a flap for it and I can see a little bit now but it is still almost shooting blind. Would like to have the viewfinder in my next camera.

I bought this camera, plus accessories and a memory chip. I went out and took about 400 pictures. When it was time to put them into my computer I discovered it is not compatible with Macintosh.

This is the Worst camera I've ever owned. I'm not exaggerating. I'm so upset for wasting money on it. The only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. It takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. The video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. I sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. My friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. It just plain sucks.
