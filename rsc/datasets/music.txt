I always believed that Carrie wouldn't fail in make a good second album, even with the pressure of the awards that she won, especially the Grammy's.The album is more country sound than "Some Hearts" and that's not a bad thing, because even sounding more country she will keep her fans and probably will make new ones.I was surprised how Carrie sounded good singing the uptempo songs, she improved a lot and sounds more honest than she sounded in "Some Hearts"My favorite's songs are "You Won't Find This", "The More Boys I Meet" and "So Small".I think Carrie made an album that will make her fans happy, her label happy and herself too, just the haters that won't.

I'm not entirely sure what kind of sound Britney was going for on this album. She experiments with several different kinds. And it seems as though she's trying to invent a new sound that hasn't been done before. It's a mix of dance, trance, and techno. This new "sound" is found on several tracks on Blackout. The sound is so different that I've found it a little hard to get use to. I had to give the album several listens before I could fully appreciate the new direction Britney is taking her music. She's saying goodbye to bubble gum pop and introducing us to some very interesting tracks. The album's first single "Gimme More" is probably the most popish song on the album. The next track "Piece of Me" has a very unusual feel to it. The lyrics are fitting. Brit basically talks about all of the attention she gets from the media. The beat is unusually catchy, with jarring sirens and some cool sound effects. This track seems to be a fan favorite. The next track is "Radar". This is a very fun upbeat song. It's simple, not too over the top like some of the other tracks. The following track, "Break the Ice" is one of my favorites. It's incredibly sexy and delivers some fun lyrics. It's also got a great beat. The next track is "Heaven on Earth". This song has got a techno vibe to it. It reminds me of 80's rave music. It's a fun track you can just zone out to. Next we have a string of bizarre tracks..."Get Naked", "Freakshow", "Toy Soldier", and "Hot as Ice" are almost unbearable to me. None of these tracks have a steady beat and the melody in each one is all over the place. Like I said, this new sound Britney experiments with on Blackout doesn't work for all of the tracks. When I put this album on I literally have to skip past these four tracks because they sound messy and disorganized. Next is "Ooh Ooh Baby". I like this song because it has a nice melody and it's got a laid back vibe to it. It's not as much of a dance number as some of the other songs. The next track is "Perfect Lover". I love this song. It's got a great beat, it's incredibly sexy, and the lyrics are hot. This track would be a great club banger. The last, and for me the most memorable track on the album, is "Why Should I Be Sad?". I love this song. It's the closest thing to a ballad on Blackout and the lyrics are great. I would like to see Brit release this as a single so she can put Kfed to shame. He's a creep and he deserves to get ousted for the things he did to Brit (which she talks about on this track). As a whole this album is different than anything out right now. Most people will put it in a pop category. But this is definitely not pop music. There are a couple of pop tracks, but this album experiments with several different sounds. It was practically made for underground clubs and raves. However, the album is a little too out there at times. But still, it's worth a listen. And it definitely shows that Brit's still got a little fire in her, despite what we see in the media.  My favorite tracks:1. Why Should I Be Sad?2. Perfect Lover3. Break the Ice4. Ooh Ooh Baby5. Radar

I have been a Britney fan for a long time, but after seeing the VMA's I was skeptical about how "Blackout" would turn out. But, after reading critic reviews about it actually being good, I thought that I would try it out... It is AWESOME!! I absolutely love this record!! She has done it again. It has many club-worthy beats and songs to workout to (which I love!!). Go buy it Go buy it!! You will not be sorry!!!

I was excited about getting this compact disc about Wicked, the hottest ticket on Broadway. I liked the beginning about how the witch was born green. I think the compact disc does serve a service in providing us a closer view of the musical itself. I didn't care for the story involving Glinda, the good witch, and Elfaba, the bad witch who is green. I didn't like the story itself. While I am sure that the musical is much better than just listening to it but I was uncomfortable with Elfaba's portrayal as being born green and bad while Glinda was both popular and pretty. I think I was just more sympathetic towards Elfaba because she was the outcast and I always find myself among the outcasts so I felt sorry for Elfaba. I don't find much sympathy for Glinda who has spent her entire life being both popular and gifted so of course, she doesn't change. She gets rewarded while poor Elfaba gets treated as bad.

To my friends Chris, Duffy, Doug, Christy, Cathy C, Josie, Cathy G, Cindy, Tom and the whole AU Crew. We rocked on "E" street when it all began. They were the best of times...with the aurora rising behind us. This album is fun and at times reminds me of the early days. Especially the songs 'Girls in their summer Clothes' and "I'll work for your love'. These are classic Springsteen tunes that really remind me of the fun we had together. Now I am Fat and old...and rich (thanks Howie). Who can ever forget those early days in McDowell Hall. Remember when Bruce, Clarence and the crew came to visit? Where was I? Drunk probably. Well you guys really rock and I miss the good ol days. What ever happened to Crazy Dave's cat? Thanks for the memories. Thanks Bruce, Little Stevie and the "E" street band...and, of course...the Big Man..The General

Alison Krauss and her brother, Victor, the bassist for Lyle Lovett, are big-time 1970's/80's rock band fans.  This is no doubt a "dream" project.  In that regard, it has all the makings of an interesting production, with the estimable talents of Mr. T-Bone Burnett.  In this case, the sum of the parts is less than the whole, unfortunately.  Every single one of the musicians and the singers are superb, but the whole product is... missing something mostly.  I have listened to this several times, with several people, and everyone sees it as good at best.  Recommended for a good but not great listen.

The album is pretty good. Unlike many others here (the 1-2 star folks) I appreciate the 60's-like anti-war sentiment, and flipping the bird at Bush & Cheney. I'm glad that the conservative goofballs are listening to this album, even if they bash it with bad reviews. Fogerty has guts. He writes meaningful and provocative music. I like the way his music sounds. I like the way it makes me feel. Kudos to John Fogerty for ticking off a bunch of close-minded individuals who can't accept that war and our soon-to-be outta there president are both bad.

Don't get me wrong, this is a very good album with great song writing but I have to agree with others who have complained about the sound quality of the album.  At first I thought I had screwed up the settings on my ipod but after I played the songs on my stereo with the same results, I was really disappointed.  It's really a shame because with a good sound mixing job I think this would've been a truly great album.  As it is now, I can barely listen to it without getting a headache.All those great riffs and lyrics get buried in an avalanche of noise.  I can only guess that this was done on purpose for some reason.  I guess it does make the album seem more nostalgic but it comes at the cost of making the album painful to listen to.My favorite song on the album is "Girls in their summer clothes."  Like Bruce, I often look back on lost youth and yearn for those days again.

This man has the voice and range to become the next great tenor in the Opera world.  With the proper management and handling he will be a huge star.  Not only his version of Nessun Dorma, but all of the songs on this album are great.  Paul Potts is terrific.

It's symptomatic of middle-age, I suppose, to reflect warmly on "the good old days", and even though I never wanted to fall into that syndrome, seeing "Help" has done exactly that for me. I was a Freshman in college when the movie was released, and so it was a movie for the millions of Boomers like me, in that bizarre, wonderful time that was the mid-1960's in America. Others have already written far more insightfully and fully than I intend to here. Simply -- if you like the Beatles, their witty, irreverent, and intellectual sense of humor, their music, and the whole 60's "British Invasion" period, you will surely enjoy this comedy. It was one last cheerful, happy, ridiculous romp for we teenagers of the 60's before the somber, discouraging misery of Vietnam settled in for a long, long time. It could be argued that, in a sense, my generation lost its sense of humor after "Help".... If a movie like "Help" were released today it would fall flat and be ridiculed, unless it were positioned as some kind of Austin Powers spinoff and "spoof" (how sick I've become of that word) of the "Hippie" period. Would this happen because as a people we never have regained that genuinely mirthful, joyous sense of humor that we revelled in in other Richard Lester movies, like "The Three Musketeers", "A Hard Day's Night", and Franco Zefferelli's "The Taming of the Shrew"? You make your own call... my generation lived it.  Isn't it a pity that you can't buy "Help" new anymore? Isn't it interesting that the company that produced "Help" on DVD is MPI -- which is the same company that, despite overpowering demand, somehow cannot find it possible to release an even more popular, Academy Award-winning movie from the mid-Sixties -- "Becket"? Isn't it a pity that you can't buy both "A Hard Day's Night" and "Help" as a set? Isn't it a pity that no one makes movies like "Help" anymore?*********** November 2007 *************   Much to my astonishment, somehow Capitol bought or won the rights to this movie away from MPI, and it's been released on two DVD editions. I bought one and enjoyed it quite a lot. I know the purists are going to be unhappy about the full-screen attributes versus the widescreen ones, etc., but the images are crisp, clear, and have rich color saturation. The sound is quite good also, and you can listen to the movie in 5.1 if you want to. Enjoy!

Forget it sounding like the old CCR, forget the great lyrics that tell it like it is and should be, and forget the harmonious melodies that are as catchy as "Who'll Stop the Rain". Please, believe me an old rock n roll lover, run out ( or should I say, get to your keyboard and get it into your [...] cart ) and get this new one from J.F. fast. I can't seem to drive anywhere without it blasting in my truck. BRAVO, Mr J.F. - you were CCR's sould and fire !

Okay... so I began listening to the CD the day it arrived. Was working in my home office and completely enjoying Josh's rich voice when, all of a sudden, out of my happy reverie I realized that I was anticipating the next full-blown ending to the song arrangement. Took me only a milisecond to say out loud, "this is DEFINITELY a David Foster CD!" To that point I hadn't even looked at the album notes, etc. But Mr. Foster came through loud and clear, even louder and clearer than Josh. While I consider David Foster to be a very talented man, I do feel that his arrangements should never eclipse the talents of the singers he works with. And with Josh Groban, eclipsing would almost be the unforgivable sin. (yes, I'm smiling as I type that last sentiment)As for a few of the details of the album, I was jarred beyond belief by the duet with Faith Hill. The arrangement was AWFUL in my opinion, and comparing her voice (in THIS song) with our dear Mr. Groban's is like gravel to velvet... deep dark chocolate brown velv... but I digress. Whew! (coming back to the task at hand here) The only other song that I wish had had the reins pulled back on just a tad was "O Come All Ye Faithful."  While the Tabernacle Choir is outstanding when heard in person, I've never yet enjoyed any of their recordings. It's almost as if their vocal power is too big for any recording to do justice to. It's the same in this version and as powerful and lovely and full and rich and... again I digress... as Josh's voice is, even he wasn't able to overshadow the wildly dramatic arrangement and the combined vocal power of the choir. It just wasn't worthy of being included on this album.Last but definitely not least, where oh WHERE was "O Holy Night"????????? I'll just have to have him over for Christmas this year to sing it for me. I can just see him  now... sitting in my living room by the tree, gazing at me with those deep brown eyes, quietly singing those first beautiful notes ---- Sorry kids, this is one digression I'm not coming back from!

Let's face it; what can you do with songs that have been recorded hundreds of times & are as familiar as the back of your hand?  Josh Groban does a LOT!The entire album will please any bonafide Josh Junkie; myself included.  Paticularly pleasant carols with a fresh twist are LITTLE DRUMMER BOY (Andy Mckee on guitar) with the slightest Spanish Flair, that is repeated on WHAT CHILD IS THIS? with a rather subdued and all too short violin solo by old friend Lucia Micarelli & ANGELS WE HAVE HEARD ON HIGH (duet with Brian Mcknight) is quite beautifulTHANKFUL is the kind of song that will grow on you with every subsequent listening and Josh is in strong voice as he also is on PETITE PAPA NOEL; a nice french song.  One may or may not like the soldiers greetings that have been added to I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS and although THE FIRST NOEL starts out just beautifully, as the song builds to a crescendo, the choir grows louder, Faith Hill is practically screeching; making the sheer volume of the ending messy & totally overpowering. However PANIS ANGELICUS is the song that will send shivers down your spine.  The voice is deep, strong, everything that Josh is known for.  Backed up with superb orchastration...this is Josh, this IS the album.  This is Christmas!

I haven't seen the musical yet (though I've been dying to and tried with all my might to get tickets when they were in town). I've learned the whole score and can sing most of it by memory. I love almost all of the songs and have plans to use one of them for an audition soon.However, the musical storyline is much different from the book storyline that I adored. That sometimes makes it difficult to imagine where in the story the songs are about (like Glenda being engaged to Fiyero).Other than that, I loved this score. It's become one of my new favorites and is always being played on my iPod.

I've missed the sound of the E-Street Band and finally an album where they are all back to form. For me, this is the best album since the BORN IN THE USA. I love all the songs from the rockin' "Radio Nowhere" to the introspective "Devil's Arcade". Bruce has always been a master storyteller and poet, and the imagery in this album is clever. I don't always agree with all of Springsteen's views, but I've always admired his passion.

We've given up on Paul McCartney ever producing another truly great album, same with the Stones.  But one great star from the 60's has produced a great, great CD - John Fogerty.  Pick this up and enjoy. Now that John has embraced the Creedence sound again, maybe there's hope he'll make up with Stu and Doug and play those Creedence songs one more time.

I saw the Beatles on Ed Sullivan. I bought every record they ever made. And I still sing along with them even in the elevator (curse the Muzak Gods that they should mock the Fab Four!).<p>Okay. Ringo happens upon a large bloodstoned ring, which will not come off! From London, to Scotland Yard to the Bahamas, Ringo is pursued by the Evil Cult of Kali, for he who wears the Ring, shall be doused in red paint and cut, jolly, with a knife, in sacrifice to the Goddess Kali. <p>There is so much of the Beatles comedic personality here. You have Ringo pursued by the Cult, a Mad Scientist bent on (Dare We Say It)ruling the world while complaining about British parts in his scientific tools, Paul shrunk into an ashtray and coverd with soda ("ick, I'm all sticky...") and John suggesting Ringo cut his hand off to save the free world. Not to mention George cheating at cards, a channel swimmer emerging in an alpine lake asking directions to the White Cliffs of Dover, and an inept pack of Kali worshippers in a schilling cab equipped with Bond-like accessories.<p>Did I mention the soundtrack? You WILL stand in front of the telly and sing along with every single song, because each one has comedic scenes, and just because we all know them. <p>The movie abounds with impromptu humor (mostly from John, oh how we miss him) and sight gags.<p>This is NOT an easy DVD to find, and it is a must have for any fan or collector, Beatle or otherwise.

After the melancholy undertones of her previous brilliant album, Bare, I didn't know what to expect from Annie's latest offering. The fact that the album was called "Songs of Mass Destruction" led me to believe it might be a bit more aggressive and edgy. It is that and a thousand times more. Strong, fragile, angry, determined, inspired, inspiring, heartbreaking, devastated, hopeful, and fearlessly inventive. Overall, it's just an amazing accomplishment from an amazing artist. And it's great to see her rip into a song like she does more than once in this collection with all the conviction and emotional complexity of some of the legendary blues artists, sometimes pounding out over some driving rhythms that feel like a modern day battle cry.Also, it's a less than subtle reminder that in the age of Britney, Linsay, Paris, and the rest of the blah-di-blahs, true art is accomplished with experience, intelligence and determination. Not to mention, that this 52-year-old rock goddess has more power and audacious brilliance in one raised eyebrow than all those 20-something train-wrecks combined. If this is what they consider "over the hill", I can't wait to get there. A friend of mine said it best: "Annie is only reason to own ears. Period." I couldn't agree more. So, thank you, Ms. Lennox, for reminding me why I love music and why it is an important art form.   PS. Downloading the album from iTunes has a few added treats, such as live versions of Walking On Broken Glass and Little Bird from the Diva album and audio commentaries for three of the songs from this album, Dark Road, Smithereens and Sing.

I love this CD.  These two artists are wonderful together and while the album pairs them on some tracks they are also wonderful solo.  My three and four year old sons have been listening to this in the car everywhere we go and they love "Please Read the Letter."  I couldn't wait to buy this at the store and I was not disappointed.  Every song is great.  There are real touches of both of the artists craftmanship.  Two thumbs up!

Kid Rock hyped this album like it was the greatest rock album of all time.  I expected it to rock and roll not exploit other songs.  This short 11 track album is so redundant it is pathetic. I kept waiting for the fireworks but was disappointed.  Take my advice and skip this album.  Pick up the preceding self titled album and don't encourage Kid's success, it has obviously went to his head with this effortless garbage of a CD.

Britney has reinvented herself with her new album "Blackout". The style and the tone of the album are totally different from her other albums, which makes Blackout - unique and interesting.Unlike the previous album, "In The Zone" (very promiscuous in styles), Britney's new album is mainly focused on style of music - dance music. And how great it turned out. The music is so professional and atchy, it is obvious that Britney is a huge worlwide pop star, not a beginner.1. Gimme More - very hot song, a huge hit that we all heard. Perfectly sets the tone for all the album. Vocal is hot. Everyone loves the song.2. Piece Of Me - song, that proves that this album is a new style for Britney. totally different and definitely hot, a little bit inspired by Fergie style.3. Radar - fun and hot, really catchy song. Could be a good single.4. Break The Ice - one of my favourite tracks. I've heard it before the album came out and it became my favourite. It's perfect. Her gentle vocal is the best on album (starts from 0:35 of the song), I love that tone of her voice.5. Heaven On Earth - very much like And Then We Kiss from "B In The Mix" - has a techno European style, brutal but hot.6. Get Naked (I Got A Plan) - very much like Nelly Furtado or Justin Timberlake style, very much like Timbaland. It's freaking HOT. Much better than other artists' songs. Sexy.7. Freakshow - very fun and hot song. Kind of like Brave New Girl from "In The Zone" but hip-pop centred.8. Toy Soldier - very hot, her voice is different. The song is outgoing and fun, video would be perfect if she walks down the street and dances.9. Hot As Ice - third and the last song that I have heard before the album. And again - one of my favourites (weird how that happenes, song I've heard before become my favourite). The weird thing is that her vocal is much worse than on the demo. They should have left her clear voice, but the whole album's disadvantage is that her voice is very computerized, no songs like Baby Boy, which is not really good for me. But still it's totally hot and electric.10. Ooh Ooh Baby - what a hot song, what a HOTTTT beginning with this guitar. I love it.11. Perfect Lover - a potential hit, very good and popular hip-hop style, very hot and sexy.12. Why Should I Be Sad - good ending song, familiar bell in the background, very nice and relaxing song.All the songs are hits, aren't they?Potential singles except Gimme More : Piece Of Me (doesn't seem like the best song, but the style is very popular and the song is just electric). Break The Ice - I am 100% positive that this WILL be a single, because it's awesome, perfect formula for a hit, catchy music and the best vocal ever. Toy Soldier - would be a good single. Hot As Ice - I doubt it because her voice and the music is too computerized comparing to the demo but I wish it could be. Perfect Lover - very modern, very cool, great potential. Ooh Ooh Baby could be a hit too, other songs aren't worse and would most likely work. So BLACKOUT is a state of art, it's totally electric and catchy, hot and sexy, joyful and fun.For us, fans, it's sad that there is not much of Britney's personality like in her other albums, everything is kind of computerized and packaged. I mean it's totally a high quality album, but I don't see Britney in some songs. She did not even write anything in the booklet. It is definitely one of her BEST ALBUMS and one of THE BEST ALBUMS OF THE DECADE for sure.I love its urban, European, techno music style. Britney is on FIRE. She is hot and she is the best. Like we had any doubts, right? :)It is a critically acclaimed album and that's what matters. Sales don't matter. Actually, very often critics and people like album but it doesn't sell that much and in other occasions critics hate it, but it sells and it's good. It's all diferent and it all depends on artist. I really hope that it sells but what matters to me is Britney and the fact that she HAS FANS and WE LOVE HER. WOO-HOO. 30th of OCTOBER isa HOLIDAY FOR ME.The photoshoot for the album is one of her best. HOT, SEXY, REVEALING. I just love it. The Confessional shoot, the Dressing Room,The Phone Call picture, The Red Flower Room , The Roses On The Floor Room - everything is hot! I love that blue dress picture - it's the best. Confessions photos are so sexy, I can't stop looking.

I think all four of those weirdos did a terrifc job with the movie even though they're not actors! In this movie you can tell John is really funny! George shows that he is not shy and serious but he's just as wacky as the others. Somebody said the producers should cut out all of Ringo's parts but if they did there would be no movie! Help is focused on Ringo's sacrficial ring he's wearing!

While most country stars go forward and reach for mainstream pop records, like Faith Hill, Carrie Underwood went in reverse. Her first disc had more than a few pop elements but this disc starts off with a foot stomper, "Flat on The Floor" and doesn't let up with fiddles, twang and chorus after chorus that will make you want to shout them out of your car windows. To say she has made a solid country disc in the vein of vintage Reba or Dolly is an understatement. Underwood has even learned some new vocal tricks, as if she needed more, "Get Out of This Town," builds from an already assured vocal into a firestorm. Underwood isn't afraid to just go with the vocal and give a stronger reading as well. That was evident in her cover of "I'll Stand By You," which was simply stunning. "Carnival Ride," is void of any weak tracks and this day and age that's a rare finding, some are stronger than others but, Jebus, the girl is giving her all to prove that she's a more than just a pretty face whom sings country, she's trying to prove it's in her blood. And when you hear "You Won't Find This," that brings about that sing songy chorus that Shania Twain loves so much, you'll be a happy camper with your purchase.

Carrie Underwood really knocked it out of the park on her sophmore album!  This CD is fantastic!  She sounds excellent, the songs are great and she should be very proud of this project.  There's a nice mix of fun songs (The More Boys I Meet) and deeply moving songs (Just A Dream)."Just A Dream" brought me to tears the first (and every time after) I heard it.  "The More Boys I Meet" could be the anthem of every young women out there dating and just makes you laugh!  "So Small" should be the anthem we all live our lives by - this song reminds me that the things I take so seriously don't really matter when it comes right down to it.  "I Told You So" is a beautiful remake of a great old song!Thank you Carrie for another great collection of songs!

It may not top Devil Without A Cause,but it is a solid rock effort.It has the trademark Kid Rock bangers and laid back slow ones.Rock N Roll Jesus,Amen,All Summer Long,So Hot and Don't Tell Me U Love Me are the standout tracks. 2 bonus tracks are included on the version I purchased from a local record store,beside the other bonus track included on all copies. Guilty and a "Live" version of, Jackson,Mississippi.Guilty is a real cool rocker which should have been included on the album anyway.If you like the Kid's music and have supported him ,check this one out. It is real good stuff. A solid 4.5 from me. get it now!!!!

I'm a musical fan, especially the really sing-able ones, and this one thoroughly satisfies me.  I like these arrangements and having the soundtrack enhanced my enjoyment of the stage production immensely.  I heartily endorse this CD.

Doesn't surprise me people are comparing it to the River.  It's in many respects, The River Lite.  It has a couple explosive songs like Radio Nowhere and the Devils Arcade and then a handful of songs that are so jingly-jangly it could pass as a Christmas Album. But I'm sure the majority of Bruce fans will find this a treat compared to the over produced Rising and the rootsy band of cover musicians he used for his Seeger tribute.The album jams out in a rushed, explosive sound like his Born in the USA days, but still isn't that strong top to bottom.  I literally can't stand his voice on the song "Your own worst enemy."  What is that whine he employs?  Roy Orbison?  No way.  There's a couple songs where he seems just totally out of his element vocally and this one illustrates this.  He should let his wife sing this one.  It doesn't work for him.But since most of his hardcore fans don't really listen to much else, this should satisfy them.  It has the same mix of redundant, heard before   Clarence riffs and even lets Lofgren almost grab your attention on a couple songs.  But not too much so, after all, it's a Springsteen album, folks.No, Bruce is the best kind of Commercial for a population of music fans who snub their nose to most music and limit their purchasing power to only that handful of bands they've been listening to since Born to Run.

The only magic on this album is the fact that someone made the Boss vanish before our very eyes.  Listening to this CD, I couldn't wait for the next track...it had to get better.  It didn't.

The cover art of Foo's ESP&G reminds one of their 1995 self-titled debut: muted background, centered layout, a weapon overwhelming the space. But if you go in hoping for some of the old Foo magic, you'll be sadly disappointed. We've come to accept the fact that the Foo of old is gone, which is surprising considering how little the band seems to evolve anymore. They try new tricks each time out, sure, but it's all in the same framework as ever. Everything is primed for mass consumption. It's arena-friendly in the sort of way that would make bands like Kansas and Foreginer proud. The productions are slick and uncorrupted. There's so little breathing room in each radio-friendly nugget because they're designed with the same sort of affection we would hope for, but not in the way that we would hope for. Even the softest and gentlest ballads sound like little more than very subdued anthems.But if you're going to depend on any band earning major airplay to fill an arena, you might as well go with Foo Fighters. After all, they do it better than almost any of their peers by a long shot, and even while we wish for more, the resulting product is almost always satisfying. Grohl and company are older and wiser now; can we really expect the same sort of energy and aggression as before? But to play it so safe is still a deflating realization. The songs are built to be sung along to, packaged for commercial success, and we swallow each pill without choking. It's very easy to like this album. It's near impossible to be passionate about it.Like most Foo records, this one opens the gates with thrust and gusto as first single "The Pretender" builds up steam and charges full-speed ahead. "Let It Die" comes next, following the patented method of a story of two halves: one slowly building but spare and simple, the other galloping and loud, letting the freak flag of rawk fly. "Erase/Replace" is the standard issue Foo rocker, fun but forgettable and easy going down. They can do appealing acoustic ditties well, too, though. "Stranger Things Have Happened" moves surprisingly quickly for a five-minute plus ballad. "Home" is a pretty piano ballad that recalls Jackson Browne in a good way. The problems come when they want heavy guitars rolling along on creaky and derivative melodies that would feel more at home in the hands of the Goo Goo Dolls. "Long Road to Ruin," "Cheer Up Boys, Your Makeup Is Running," and "Statues" are the prime offenders of these crimes, and they're easily the weakest tracks of an already uneven batch. Even "Summer's End," which has an undeniable folk heart sprinkled with good-ol-boy 70s rock flourishes, is a tale of two cities, both at odds, neither happy to share space. Buffalo Springfield could have made it work; Foo just look lost.That they would try an eclectic collection like this is heartening, though. Their other albums were distinctively marked in niches. Even when early Foo tried to change things up by going the mellow pop route with songs like "Big Me" and "Walking After You," they followed the distinctive patterns of the surrounding material. And In Your Honor had two very divergent styles, but they were separated on opposing sides, each of which were almost TOO "samey" on either end. But if they think they're doing Led Zeppelin's III by loading the disc with nearly as many mid-tempo numbers as zippy hard rockers, they have to figure out how to do the music in between the extremes. Grohl alone with an acoustic guitar and simple but heartfelt lyrics is fine. The whole band playing fast and heavy with slick but fun gate-chargers is quite good as well. Trying to coast along in the middle ground is a tough mission, one that I wonder if Grohl and the boys are capable of succeeding. I wish it were different--Grohl seems an affable and fun guy, he's a hell of a drummer and no slouch on the guitar, and the rest of the band offers solid support and better--but it's tough to think otherwise anymore.Best cuts: "Stranger Things Have Happened," "The Pretender," "Home," "Let It Die," "The Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners," "Erase/Replace," "Come Alive"

Schwartzs' Wicked certainly "defies gravity" from the get go.. from No One Mourns the Wicked to the Finale one is transformed to a magical word that begs the question "Is itOK" to follow your chosen path.. A must for the creative and those who seek to be who they are...MARVELOUS

Actually, everything's already been said in the other glowing reviews, but it seems I have to write a review myself in order to give John the 5 stars he deserves. I`ve got all the CCR albums and some of John's solo releases, most notably Centerfield, but this album, in my humble opinion, contains some of the finest music he's done since the early 1970s. I must have played it four times straight, which is unusual, though, to be honest, the last time I did that was a few weeks ago when I picked up Bruce Springsteen's new CD, which likewise blew me away. It seems those old rockers won't fade away. "Summer of Love" struck me as being a strangely familiar track, when I realised it's a cross between Byran Adams' "The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You" and Cream's "White Room", but it rocks righteously makes your hairs stand on edge. Check out Gunslinger, Creedence Song and Long Dark Night, too.

This album takes the longtime Springsteen fan back to basics, at the very least to 1984 (if not farther).  It erases the subpar 90s Springsteen catalog in under 50 minutes.  How does it do it?  With less trickery than you'd think:  earnest singing and forthright playing (Max's drums are superior).  Not a single song to fast forward.  That's why this guy is still the Boss: what other band has stepped up to take the title from him?

While listening to Revival, I couldnt help to think back to my high school days when CCR ruled the airwaves.  John Fogerty has again found the sound that he left behind when Creedence broke up in the early 70's. The guitar riffs, the beat, the tempo, its all there.  This is his greatest album since CCR.  If you sing along with the radio when a Creedence song comes on, this album is for you.  Welcome back to Rock & Roll, John!!!!

As a die-hard Springsteen fan, I'm torn about this album.  The lyrics are as intricate and involving as usual, and we get the typical Springsteen switch-up from fast hard-rocking songs to gut-wrenching quiet songs.  But the production is so overdone that it's as if he's singing through a veil, and everything tends to sound too much alike.  There are some songs that stick in my head - Radio Nowhere, Long Walk Home, Devil's Arcade - but other songs that reviewers mention (Girls in their Summer Dresses) do nothing for me.  If we get a concert album out of the current tour more songs may turn out to be appealing, but if you're looking for a great, consistently enjoyable recent Springsteen album, buy the Dublin Live set.

I have only heard of Paul Potts recently and believe me I don't live in a box, at least not when it comes to music and books.  I saw his audition for British Idol on youtube and was blown away.  It gave me chills just listening to him.  The fact that he is just your average person with no classical training is what I think draws the masses to his humble nature.  Frankly I don't care that other reviewers think that he needs more polishing in his voice.  The miracle that he can now be heard around the world is his triumph.

First I will say that I've been a fan of Britney's music since day 1.  When this album first came out, I had to think hard about whether or not to buy it..I like "Gimme More" but thought the clips I heard on YouTube sounded 'rushed'. But about three days after its release, I gave in and bought it cause it was only $9.99 at circuit city. I was surprised by how good it is. It's pretty addicting actually..the key songs are "Gimme More", "Break the Ice"(lashing out at the media), "Radar","Ooh Ooh Baby", and "Hot as Ice". This album definitely is quite a bit different than her others (which is another reason i was contemplating getting it) but still sounds like her at the same time. In my opinion her self titled album "britney" was her best album. This one isn't as good, but it's a cd worth buying or at least listening to. Better than "In the Zone" which had some not so great songs on it. Anyway, my point is it's pretty darn good and if you've been thinking about it...go for it. Chances are you won't be disappointed.

The CD took FOREVER to arrive and I have no idea why.  I called post offices and wrote amazon.  Amazon responded well and offered to refund my money.  Then the cd arrived.  I think that experience of waiting almost 3 weeks took the joy out of the purchase.  The music is good but so short.  I think 11 songs and they are all quite short.  Oh well.  Potts is a great singer and I wish him all the best.

For anyone who has read my reviews before, you know that I don't like to write a lengthy review of each individual song on an album. I prefer to let the listener pick his or her favorites after listening to the album themselves. Especially with Bruce, I think you have to look at each of his releases as an entire piece of work. As a Bruce Tramp for 37 years I know that certain songs which grab me in the first few listenings may very well not be my favorites later on. And, I think alot of us are like that. I'm not knocking the reviewers who choose to review song by song. That's just not my way. So, with that said, I'd like to talk to three different groups of listeners. First, The tried and true Bruce Tramps like myself. I could simply say forget it, go out and buy it, and enjoy! But, it deserves a little more than that. For you folks, this is Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band. As Kid Leo from Cleveland said very well back in '75," Welcome to the main event! Pound for pound, round for round, there ain't no finer band around, Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band!". There's one thing that there's never any mystery with each and every release this man gives us - it's going to be great. From beginning to end, there are no fillers. This is the deal! Don't waste your brain power by attempting to compare it with any of Bruce's other releases. I hate that! It's a piece of work of it's own, ad people do change with age and maturation. Bruce is no different than any of us in that context. I will simply tell you that with each listening, each song begins to take over your mind sounding better and better as time goes. There seems to be a little of Bruce in this album probably starting with Born To Run all the way through to and including Devils and Dust. I leave The Seeger Sessions out of that comment because that was a whole different piece of genius in itself. Is there any one of us Bruce Tramps that thought back after "Greetings" was released that thought Bruce could have pulled off that? And, he did! With a great band, giving those over hundred year old songs a kick in the butt! Just keep playing "Magic" - you're gonna call it a classic with time.To the Springsteen fans who didn't like it when Bruce gave up The E Street music with releases such as Nebraska, Tom Joad, Devils and Dust, etc. Hey, it's not too late to get back in line with us Bruce Tramps. We've saved you a spot. This man is the single greatest musical artist of our age. He has proven that with so many different types of work. If you didn't particularly care for the albums I mentioned, give them a few more listens. Like most of Bruce's career work, if you listen to a song say 50 times, there will be many times that you will say to yourself, "Gee, I'm getting a whole new meaning out of that phrase than I did before". If you've really gotten off the band wagon, well, so be it.To the people who have never listened to Bruce(you mean there are some of you?), this just might be the album for you to start with. There are alot of little things on this album that Bruce has barely touched on in the past, soundwise. It sounds like a contradiction to say that this is The E Street Band, and then make the statement that I just made. But, with Bruce, the old fans know what I mean. It's kind of like during the Devils and Dust Tour, when Bruce would do an old one like "Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?". Some people in the audience didn't recognize the song until the third or fourth verse. But, that's where some of the genious comes in, and also what keeps Bruce's shows fresh for we fans and the Band itself. He's so spontaneous in everything he does, it's amazing!I would like to mention one song on the album that deserves special mention. That's the one that most everyone is calling "Terry's Song". It's not listed on the album, so when Devils Arcade is over don't turn the player off. You'll be cheating yourself out of an absolute classic. I call it Bruce's eulogy to his long-time compadre and right-hand man, Terry McGovern, who recently passed away. It is just a truly beautiful way of paying tribute to a buddy who must have meant more to Bruce than any one of us ever knew. It brought tears to my eyes, and it may to yours.In closing, I'd like to mention that another of my heroes of a different genre of music, Merle Haggard, years ago, was given the moniker "The Poet Of The Common Man". That moniker could have easily been given to Bruce. Because that is what he is, a poet of the common man. It's been said that when you listen to Merle Haggard, you're listening to his life. The same can be said of Bruce. All the way back from the beginning with "Greetings From Asbury Park". This album, "Magic" is just another chapter. I can't wait to read the next one! Thanks for your time.

I have to admit that I wasn't expecting much from this album but I decided to get it: THAT WAS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER DONE!! I LOVE EVERY SONG!! I normally don't like this type of pop/techno but this was FABULOUS!!! I can't wait for her music videos and hopefully America will change and start loving her again.  She has done a wonderful job on this album.

The first review I read about this CD was It's NOT the "The Rising", well it's not supposed to be. The music presented here by the Boss & Crew is new & a well crafted, great CD. Most bands create music first & lyrics to fit, but Bruce writes great lyrics & then surrounds them with first rate music by the worlds most gifted musicians. This CD stands on its own merit as another masterpiece of Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band. Listeners need to absorb it for what it is, not compare it to anything else the band has recorded.

If the old timers in Appalachia had been raised on NPR and Starbucks this is what their music would probably have sounded like.  The musicianship here is impeccable.  The production is meticulous.  There is not one note that's offensive or in bad taste.  There is also very little life to the performances.I have been an Alison Krauss fan for years and I buy all her cds even though  it's been a while since I've actually found any of them to be very interesting.  If you go back to some of her earlier recordings, before "When you say nothing at all," there was actually a little grit in her singing voice.  Listen to "It's Over" and you'll hear what I mean.  At some point, however, she started to sing in a soft, whispery voice that sounds like she's channeling Jackie Kennedy.  It's beautiful, but after a while everything begins to sound the same and she sounds less and less like a real human being.  This cd is not bad and it will make excellent background music, but these people are way to talented to be settling for that.

Carrie Underwood has taken many hits because she got her start on a TV Show.  How everyone forgets that Patsy Cline, arguably the greatest female country voice of all time,  got started the same way.  Carrie's second Album Carnival Ride validates what we already knew, that she is on her way to be one of the biggest selling artists in music.  Carrie Underwood's talent will undoubtedly carry her on for many years to come.

With so many beautifully sung songs I am puzzled as to why I don't enjoy this CD more so. No chills for me. And I was looking forward to chills. However - Josh Groban has a unique and gorgeous voice that he can use masterfully and he does so on this CD. "Noel" deserves a place in every CD collection.   I'll now share what I think hinders my ability to offer more praise for this CD. Although, as usual, there is much to praise about any CD of Josh Groban's.  Perhaps that high expectation is why,  like some, I am a bit disappointed in the CD, as a whole. I actually felt depressed after listening to it rather than uplifted and joyful. The individual songs, taken out of the context of an hour long Groban/Foster marathon, are mostly incredibly good and some beautifully fresh in their presentation but all together at one time, a bit much.  Very majestic, very dramatic but also a bit overdone with a sense of solemn sameness in many tracks. This CD validates Groban's choice to step away, to a large degree, from Foster when recording his "Awake" CD.  Foster knows what he likes to have Groban do, anthem/power ballads, and he has him do it over and over to the detriment of the over all CD experience.  I know this CD was recorded at various times throughout Groban's tour so perhaps that contributed to them unwittingly returning to too many Foster inspired arrangements without realizing how much of that had already been added to enough songs on this CD. A few is great, too many is annoying and tiresome.For me, too many songs went on long past when they should have ended. I actually become annoyed with the repeating of phrases over and over as some of the songs fade out too slowly.  Especially at the end of "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear" The woman choir member doing her thing at the end causes me reach for the skip button.Another puzzlement is the removal of the first verse of "O, Come All Ye Faithful" and the first chorus of "What Child is This?" (although I think "What Child is This" is one of the better offerings as is "Little Drummer Boy")My plan is to create my own version of this CD by reordering the songs, leaving some off ("Thankful") and fading some out sooner.

The new project by John Fogerty is simply the best record of 2007!  What was the most anticipated album of the year is finally here.  If you have read the reviews from music critics and other reviewers there is really nothing I can add that is any different.  After listening to "Revival" over and over today (at least 12 times) I can strongly recommend the purchase of this CD.John Fogerty / Creedence Clearwater Revival are the ultimate American Jukebox.  Every track is superb on this project!  However, for me the song "Summer of Love" is my favorite as it recalls that very special summer of 1967.  With sounds of Cream and Jimi Hendrix - this track ROCKS!!!  It is worth buying the CD for that song alone.Thank you John Fogerty for delivering an astounding musical journey on "Revival".  And for all those CCR gems that will last forever!!!!

So, the album is terrific, the best Springsteen has done since the Rising, but the packaging is horrific.  I only took the CD out once, and already it is scratched beyond repair.  The song Gypsy Biker skips to the point of sticking.  I don't understand the shear incompentency of people who design these cases:  you can cut down on materials and cost is ways that don't ruin the CD.  Look at David Glimour's On an Island, which uses a little nub of foam, or the last few releases by Tom Waits on the Anti- lable:  even his newest, Orphans, which uses the same cardboard squeeze-and-release style as Magic, at leaves enough room for the packaging to open enough to slide the disc out without mauling the thing.  So, thanks to iTunes, I was able to recover Magic, but there is still a bust of static in the middle of Gypsy Biker....download the album, don't waste the money supporting Columbia's poor choices.  (I had to do the same thing with Springsteen's Seger Secessions)

I know you want to talk about her pantyless partying, or her custody case.However, I suggest you do for this LP what you do to most of the movies, music and sports you enjoy.....do not too closely at the artist/player.Take it for what it is....mature sexy innovative dance album.Blackout will have you dancing from song one all the way through to number 12.

The album is definitely a natural progression of what the band did with "In Your Honor," this time fusing delicate acoustic with rowdy electric within most of the songs, with satisfying results. Still, most of the songs here don't follow the traditional pop verse-chorus structure, and as such aren't immediately memorable. But once you get an idea of how each song unfolds, it can be a rewarding listen. While it's easily more solid throughout than the longer "Honor," there isn't quite a "Best of You" here. Some songs full of potential for greatness are let down by a rather bland chorus, and repetition of lyrics is another problem in places. Even some of the more consistent tunes are nearly spoiled by outros that don't quite seem to end things on a high note."The Pretender" sports the standard-issue aggressive Foo chorus, but the delayed gratification makes it better, thanks to a great 90-second build-up. "Let It Die" isn't the first or last song here that goes quiet-to-loud, but the start-and-stop path along the way makes this one stand out. Unfortunately, Dave's primal screams seem a bit forced at the end here, as the music doesn't quite match the ferocity of the vocals. "Erase/Replace" is a heavier, sober, inconsistent number."Long Road to Ruin" is an addictive pop-rock number that's fairly straightforward, but a lot of fun. A nice change of pace made even better by one of the band's best guitar solos. One of those Foo songs that makes you glad to be alive. "Cheer Up Boys" is another uptempo rocker that lightens things up after another pair of slower, disappointing songs in "Come Alive" and "Stranger Things Have Happened." "Summer's End" is a laid-back, bouncy sing-along that shows off the diversity of the band's sound (think "Good Day Sunshine"), and another great guitar solo. But it'll probably be a puzzler for the more old-fashioned Foo fan. The instrumental "Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners," while pleasant, isn't quite as adventurous as it could've been."Statues" is part 1 of an excellent 1-2 climax, and possibly the best track here: sweeping, evocative, and moving. The band pulls out all the stops here with an orchestral background, accordion, two delicate guitar solos, and a piano utilized so well it makes you wish they'd use it more often. "But Honestly" follows it up with the final, and most cathartic, use of the album's acoustic-to-electric motif. Great interplay on vocals from both Dave and Taylor, followed by fun, out-of-left-field guitars and drums to finish things out."Home" is a simple, somber epilogue, heavy on piano but also with some drums and strings in the second half (though guitars would be a welcome addition). The lyrics are rather straightforward, and perhaps a bit too reminiscent of Lennon's "In My Life."

A truly satisfying album if you're a Springsteen fan. If you're not, it will grow on you.  This is the album that Springsteen fans have been waiting for and has been so long overdue in his familiar rock n' roll style.  Songs that stand out for me are "Livin' In the Future", "Your Own Worst Enemy", "Gypsy Biker", "Last To Die", "You'll Be "Comin' Down", "Long Walk Home" and "Girls in Their Summer Clothes".  This compilation will stand the test of time, will be great to see him do live in years to come and fit comfortably side by side with his classics.  Thank you Mr. Springsteen!

Like the book and the play, the Wicked soundtrack is mystical and magical. The cast is amazing and Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are enchanting. I recommend the soundtrack to anyone and everyone who loves a great musical fantasy. This is one soundtrack that truly sends you back to OZ. I never liked a whole album of music before Wicked. It is one CD I completely love.

I thought it was my imagination, but when I asked my sister who is a big JG fan and loves Christmas music...we both agreed that this one was a little bit of a disappointment for similar reasons! We did not get the feel of Christmas here. Similar to other major superstars like Barbara Striesand who's 2nd Christmas offering was not as great as her first.Melissa Manchester's re-issue this year of Joy is STILL great...check it out!I have the DVD edition of this product in which he says that he wanted to make a classic or timeless recording. I would agree with his idea, but he does not convey that in this recording. Surprisingly he uses men, women and children blogging about Iraq during his rendition of I'll Be Home For Christmas. I'm not saying that I do not like this song, because it is a great idea, but it should have been a single instead of part of this project. In time, it will sound as dated as Kenny G's Auld Lang Syne Millennium Mix. I like the way he does Little Drummer Boy and I think is probably the best track. I also like his duets with Brian McKnight Angels We Have Heard On High and Faith Hill dueting on The First Noel. Ave Maria is done well, but I am tired of it on every Christmas CD, it's two different versions and at every wedding and funeral I go to!I am not crazy about Panis Angelicus which is also done on Il Diva's Christmas CD. I know this most people may not agree with me about this review. I would have given it more stars if it had included his stunning version of O Holy Night and his original classic Believe (from Polar Express) and the live version of I'll Be Home For Christmas available on I Tunes.

Kid Rock's style of trying to be someone he isn't is ever more prevalent on this record. There are a few licks that remind you ever great classic rock bands, but all the too few, which in a way works in his favor. Even the cover clearly rips (I'm sure he didn't intend for it to be taken as a copy of, but a tribute) AC/DC. The writing on this record is as terrible as before, and all the guitar, drum, rap mashing is still tiresome. This isn't rock. This isn't hip-hop. It's someone trying to be better than he is. Next time, Kid Rock needs to write his own lyrics, his own chords and riffs, and be the real Kid Rock and show what really goes on inside his mind, and not the minds of producers.

Lets face it folks. Bruce Springsteen's last efforts haven't been very good.  Let's start back in the late 80's, with Tunnel of Love. Lame. Human Touch and Lucky Town. Boring. The Ghost of Tom Joad was a record with an acoustic guitar and a mumbling man. Devils and Dust wasn't all that impressive either, but THIS. THIS is magical.Springsteen hasn't sounded this good since 1984/5. Every cut is solid, and will have you wondering why he ever decided to split with the E Street Band.  It will leave you satisfied. Buy it, now.

When I started listening to the CD, it started with her single Gimme More.  I never really liked the song but it grew on me after a while.  I figured that would be the best song on the CD and then downhill from there.  Then the next song was good...and then the next...When I got to the song "Toy Soldiers" I was blown away.  I looooove that song.  Another surprise came at the last song, so unexpectedly revealing about Kevin and moving on with her life. This CD is really good.

I agree that "Let It Die" is an amazing song and definitely my favorite from the cd.Overall I really like the first 5 songs, and it's a solid comeback for me from In Your Honor which I was dissapointed in.  In ranking it with other Foo Fighter CDS I'd have to say its probably my 3rd or 4th favorite with "One By One" being number one on my list.

Wonderful CD that reminds us of the excellent stage production we saw recently.  Some of the lyrics that the chorus sang were a little hard to understand in the live performance, but could be read in the CD notes and appreciated.

Josh has the perfect voice for these songs. He has set the bar very high for all Christmas music this year. I know this cd will be played a lot this season. A few of the songs are not our traditional (everyday) Christmas songs, but they are great, as well.You WILL enjoy this cd!!!

The CD is absolutely beautiful.  I have listened to it so many times already that I am going to have it worn out before Christmas even gets here.  This is just another one of his wonderful pieces of art.

I am very much a Led Head, but my tastes are eclectic enough to include Allison Krauss.  I bought this more out of curiosity than any other reason, but it delivers MUCH MORE than I expected.Overall, I think that Allison Krauss, Robert Plant and T Bone Burnett have achieved as close to perfection on one CD as is humanly possible.The voices - how to describe them?  There are duets, harmonies and unique amalgams of two voices into one -- one time with Robert's voice in the foreground, and the next time with Allison's voice in the foreground.  How do they do it?Also, I really appreciate good production, as it just brings me closer to the music.  The production perfectly complements the voices and instruments.I have only one caveat for listening to this CD -- It needs to be played on a very good, full-range stereo system.  On my in-ceiling speakers, the CD is merely interesting.  On my $5K stereo, golden.Buy it, find a quiet time, put it on a good system and prepare to be carried away to someplace special.

Blackout is Britneys best album to date. Its just so amazing. Every single song is capable of being released as a single. No need to use the skip button for this album, your gonna have to use the repeat button allot though cuz every single track is so hotttt!!! This album is so energetic and electrifying. Say what u want about her personal life but when it comes to her music, you cant say much but that its amazing. This album is sure to be #1!

I surprised myself that I bought this album. But after the positive reviews from music critics, I was curious. This album is fun to listen too. It seems classic Britney. Lots of mixing and techno voice work. I have a feeling if Britney actually performed one of these songs live and did not lip synch, she would not sound good. With enough money and the right people and equipment, I think anyone with any kind of voice could sound good. Look at Paris Hilton!

It's become apparent that as Bruce Springsteen gets older, that he seems to mix his output between folk records, live albums, and the occasional E Street release.  The E Street releases are the rarer of the batch, with only three having been released since 1984. I seem to like these the best. After progressively slower and more boring musical output by Springsteen, I had burnt out on him completely for awhile; stopping altogether until 2002's excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000069HKH">The Rising</a>.  I was hoping The Rising was a permanent return to form, but alas it wasn't - as he went back and did <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007WF1WS">another folk album</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E97X66">a live album</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P1KTVY">another live album</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EU1PNC">an album of covers</a>.  Yawn.  So when I heard about Magic, my first thought was it something weird, or a "real" album - an E Street album. When I heard it was an E Street album, I was quite happy about that.I first heard the single in late August 2007 when it was made available for free via iTunes.  The first single (Radio Nowhere) was a free download, which I'll always take advantage of. It's quite anthemic in it's sound - something that would have fit well on the Born in the USA album. Lyrically it reminds me of the Tom Petty album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000069KHZ">The Last DJ</a>". Anyway, fantastic track. So I pre-ordered the album straight away. When I got it, I have to admit it initially bored me. It wasn't as immediately catchy as The Rising was. But given it was E Street, I gave it a fair shake, and continued to listen. The day it was actually released (Tue the 2nd), it clicked with me (I got it early via one of my record label contacts). Can't tell you why, it's one of those "OK, I get it now" moments, which kind of makes me wonder what the heck I was thinking the first few times I listened to it.Radio Nowhere is by far the most radio friendly (ha) song on the album, so there isn't another one of those, but there's some really nice melodies on this. Some of my favorite tracks are Long Walk Home, Last to Die, and Devil's Arcade. Living in the Future has a sax hook that is seriously old school Springsteen. I'll Work for your Love also has an old school Springsteen feel to it I liked.To sum up, for someone who had just graduated High School when Born in the USA came out, this album 23 years later makes me feel like I'm back then - this doesn't feel like his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002BFL">The Ghost of Tom Joad</a> style of stuff (which I can't stand). Get it.

I find this album to be sublime in every way. its such a pleasure to hear R.P.'s voice in this context. really took me by surprise.  A.K. is wonderful on all counts (no surprise).the sonics don't suck imo. i agree that it sounds pretty natural.     there is some great playing on this thang, and i love the set of songs. plant moves me more here than he has since early zep.  the entire thing sounds totally uncontrived to me - down to the smiles in the photographs.   one of my favorite releases of the year.

The Beatles accomplished so much - good at music , good at recording and capturing their magic , good at transferring their personalities and appeal onto film . HELP ! is meant to be fun and it has some slapstick elements mostly due to Ringo's abilities as a straight man .He was always the most honest one and he holds the film together . If anyone feels he didn't do as much as the others , then this film is the evidence to the contrary .  The Beatles' humour style incorporates elements of the Goons and Peter Sellers , who was a friend of theirs .Enjoy this silly film and marvel at the best of the songs in it .

And I have never heard Clark Gable sing Lennon and McCartney!  I guess you really had to be there to really enjoy this movie.  There are few things that preserve the past like film and this one certainly does preserve the  flavor of the times.  This film does not make a great political  statement...its just a lot of fun.  You can argue movie titles, it was  originally Eight Arms to Hold You, I have the first release of  the 45 from Help and the lable on the record reads Eight  Arms to Hold You, refering obviously to four Beatles times two arms  or maybe the goddess of the religeous faithful of the movie.  Watch this  movie with someone who was there they can try to explain the feeling of the  times.  You can criticize the plot or the lack there of, but this is not  your Oscar winning Gone with the Wind...its just a lot of fun...so  enjoy!

I may have a unique perspective about this release because I have never heard any of Robert Plant's CDs and I have never listened to an Alison Krause CD. But this pairing intrigued me, and the clip of Rich Woman I heard somewhere sounded like something I'd like and prompted me to purchase the CD.It's definitely laid back for the most part, but the slower songs aren't dull at all. T-Bone Burnett's production keeps things interesting. The highlight for me is the version of Fortune Teller. Recommended.

1965's "Help", 42 years on, has a refreshing air of innocent fun about it, along with some excellent music and a silly plot involving the Beatles with a mystical but murderous Eastern Cult.It hardly seems possible that John, Paul, George, and Ringo were ever this young; "Help" captures them as their collective fame had just begun to take hold, but before it devoured them altogether.  The storyline involves a huge ring that Ringo has been given by a young girl.  Unfortunately, the ring is a key prop in an Eastern Cult that periodically sacrifices people.  The Cult, led by Leo McKern in a perfectly hilarious role, is mad to get the ring back and pursues our four young heroes from London to Salisbury Plain to Switzerland to a finale in the Bahamas.  The Cult's exotic plots to get the ring back generate a nice mixture of suspense and madcap chaos, framing a series of pre-MTV music videos featuring such hits as "Help", "You're Going To Lose That Girl" and "Ticket To Ride." Along the way, there are lots of sight gags and lots more banter among the Beatles themselves.  The humor may be slightly dated and very British, but holds up well.This movie is a priceless bit of collective memory for the baby boomers who remember the Beatles phenomenon as a current event.

Britney is something else.... the terrible VMA performance, head shaving, children, etc. i almost gave up on her..... at the end of the day it is if she delivers in the music... and she does!!!!!im sorry i kno i might not get alot of cheers...... BLACKOUT is by far her best effort... very very grown up.  with the help of Danjahands (protege of Timbaland) pharrell williams and the backing vocals of keri hilson (of timbalands "the way i are") she came out with the hottest club LP madonna wish she had!  hands down my favourite track is 'hot as ice'.... she shows sass & class... crazy track heavy rotation in my ride....my other favourite track is 'radar'... at first i thought she said operator.... LOL!!!! great dance track....other bangers: 'gimme more' (without the performance), 'why should i be sad' with pharrell, 'piece of me', & "heaven on earth"... honestly i didnt hear a track that i didnt like... she came with it... and im surprised she had the time to do this LP at all....i hope nobody gave up on britney and give her one more shot... especially her fans that gave up... i kno i was almost one of them but at the end of the day she was about the music and she does deliver....5++++ stars out of 5: way to get the haters back BRIT!!!!!!

Here's my opinion on these songs: 1. No One Mourns the Wicked - though Kristen Chenoweth is credited with this one, the entire ensemble makes it strong. Catchy. 2. Dear Old Shiz - though vocally strong, it's kind of boring. If you listen to the lyrics, they're funny. 3. The Wizard and I - easily one of the best songs on the album. Also funny. 4. What Is This Feeling? - often overlooked, but excellent. Again, the ensemble completes the song led by two excellent leads. 5. Something Bad - means a lot. Brings out a lot of the politicalness of Wicked the book. 6.  Dancing Through Life - fun, has a great mood. Almost all of the leads perform in this one. And they are great. 7. Popular - this is the first song I heard before I saw the show. It's so cute. And it is Galinda's personality (that's not a typo). Chenoweth is so strong. 8. I'm Not That Girl - it makes you feel for Elphaba. Uses quite a range. 9. One Short Day - extremely catchy. Chenoweth, Menzel, and ensemble really perform. 10. A Sentimental Man - the Wizard is one talented guy. 11. Defying Gravity - IF YOU ARE GOING TO LISTEN TO ONE SONG FROM THIS MUSICAL, THEN THIS IS IT. 'Nuff said. Idina Menzel, I bow down to you. The curtain falls on Act I with everyone smiling and looking to their friends saying, "Wow!"12. Thank Goodness - Chenoweth leads the ensemble again in this big Act II opener. 13. Wonderful - cute. Again, the Wizard sings this catchy tune. 14. I'm Not That Girl (Reprise) - brings out the heartbreak in the story. 15. As Long As You're Mine - stong. Powerful. Romantic. 16. No Good Deed - such an amazing solo. And I love the language of the Grimmerie. 17. March of the Witch Hunter - important to the plot and fun. Ties the Wizard of Oz story up. 18. For Good - If you've seen the show, you remember this one. It made everyone I know cry. And I can relate to it. 19. Finale (Wicked) - I was still drying my tears during this one. But it ends the story on one amazing high note (literally and figuratively). I'm obsessed, I know. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM.

You'd have to be a real die hard fan of Fogerty to enjoy this one.  Once upon a time, Rolling Stone named Fogerty as one of the top 50 guitarists.  He doesn't give any reason to support that claim here, mostly just rhythm guitar.  The vapid solo riffs on each song are formulaic.  The monotonous and sometimes incongruous lyrics don't add much either.It's not all terrible; Creedence Song is an ok track just right for your local open mic night band.  It starts off sounding a bit like Suzy Q, which is common in a lot of the songs.  Fogerty has taken a lot of old stuff, and reworked it.  Unfortunately, he's getting a little old to enhance his (or others) work.  But, this will ensure old fans are comfortable with it, and in turn, will shell out for the next album.

A self-named "Led Head" friend of mine told me about this CD.  His thoughts were that the world as we knew it was coming to end when Robert Plant joined up with a 'country musician'.  Having somewhat more eclectic tastes--I didn't think so. What a treat to open the CD and hear "Rich Woman" on Halloween.  A.D.D's headliner review gives the best description of the Southern Gothic 'feel'.  Another particularly eerie song is "Fortune Teller," where Plant sings the tale of a young man who goes to a fortune teller and discovers that he will fall in love with the first woman he sees--which turns out to be the Fortune Teller herself--now he's happy as can be and he gets his fortune told for free. (Yup, corny as KS--but the sound is very cool!)  For the most part, the music will probably  suit Alison Krauss fans more than Plant's, but Plant's fans need to listen--just to hear how strong the man can be on soft music.    The best of any profession are the people who raise the bar for the rest.  The test of a great collaborative work is -- is the whole better than the sum of its parts?  Plant, Krauss, and Burnett started out at the top of their respective forms, but this CD is truly a masterwork among their individual collections, too.  "Raising Sand" is going to open the door for a long more mind-bending work.

I love Kid Rock.  But I was disappointed when I heard this new album was not going to have much rap. (I don't even really like rap, just his). I must say I love this album. I hope he will do another rap album, but he better not stop making albums like this either.  I love every song.  I usually dislike songs with samplings from other artist, but "all summer long" is the one the song I keep going back to.  It is so much fun. Such a happy song. All the songs are great.  Well worth the wait.

I have enjoyed Carrie since her days on American Idol.  I loved her first CD and was a little nervous of the 'sophmore slump' with the second album.  Well I need not have worried because I absolutely loved it!!!!!!  Maybe it is the vet in me but I especially loved 'The more Boys I meet' (The more I love my Dog!!!)  I am having a hard time finding a song I don't like and skip through, it just hasn't happened yet.  I am a big country fan and glad to see that she has gone more country and less pop this time round - it suits her.  Other songs I enjoyed are 'Get out of this town' and 'Crazy Dreams' -- but as I say I have a hard time writing anything bad about this album.  So way to go Carrie - can't wait for the next one!  How about a Christmas album now!!

DRONING , BORING, POORLY MIXED GARBAGE THAT IS MEANT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK USING THE E STREET BAND'S NAME (SINCE HE HASN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL ON HIS OWN IN YEARS). MAGIC? HARDLY......TRAGIC IS A MORE APT TITLE.

"Magic" is not on par with "Born to Run," "Darkness on the Edge of Town," or "The River," but it ranks with "Born in the U.S.A." and easily surpasses Springsteen's other post-1980s albums.

Raising Sand is a wonderful collaboration between two disparate singers that sounds similar to a beached whale in it's death throes. Each song is achingly beautiful and tragic, yet bloated in a nourishing and mystical way like a blocked artery attempting to supply the heart with a diminished amount of blood plasma.  That said, I highly recommend this CD to people searching for a mutating musical identity to admire and appreciate in a cynical manner.

Great to hear the E Street Band backin full swing!   As much as I have enjoyed his "solo" work (Tunnel of Love, Devils, Seeger's Sessions) there is still nothing like E Street Band.   Too bad this didn;t come out during the summer as tunes like "Girls..." and "Living in the Future" would have been perfect tunes for walking on the Boardwalk.I don't understand so many of the reviews that complain about the "bad" sound.  Yes, it's dense but I think that's part of it's strengths.Haven't had the chance to see him on tour yet, but from what a couple of friends tell me who have gone, the Magic songs blend in really well and it looks like a couple (Long Walk Home, Living,,,,) are becoming new trademark tunes..For me, the big test is how a Bruce CD sounds in the car, driving at night.   This one aces the test!

A lot of people are saying this is their best album since There's Nothing Left to Lose. Fair enough. But I've only given this album three listens and I've giving TNLTL hundreds. I remember the first time I heard that album and being a bit disappointed that it wasn't Colour and the Shape 2. This album sounds good. The rock songs sound more "classic rock" or as a friend of mine describes the Foos, "straight ahead rock n' roll." A couple of the softer songs feature a lot of the band that took part in the acoustic tour, which I was a big fan of. I pre-ordered the iTunes version which came with a couple bonus tracks and supposedly will give me access to Foo tour pre-order.Here's a Foos thing: With the exception of TCatS, I would have rated each album one star lower prior to seeing them perform it live. They put on an amazing show. Here's hoping that continues for many more albums and tours.

I first discovered Paul in a YouTube link, and became mesmerized.  I've never cared for opera, but this guy is so "common" and "everyman" that his appeal is unavoidable.  For Simon Cowell to speak so positively (which he seldom does) about an artist said it all for me.  Paul is not professionally trained, but he sings with emotion, commitment, and integrity.  A perfect voice?  No, but a very good one that will only get better with time.  I still don't care for opera, but I have a new respect for it; have also "discovered" Pavarotti for myself, and the Three Tenors.  In summary, he is a very bright talent who will only get better.  And, even if he doesn't, he's brought attention to an art-form that doesn't often get attention from those outside the operatic afficionados.

This is wonderful listening. Even more, it's truly significant. That's in part because of the reaction _ I don't how many times in the last few months I've read about what seems to "critics'' and others to be a truly strange pairing. Something like: "You'd never expect two singers so far apart to team up, but it seems to work.''  That's nonsense (except the part about it working _ it doesn't "seem,'' it's real.) That's because the "critics'' and others put music in boxes and can't understand a pairing of "bluegrass,'' (the quotes are intentional) and heavy metal. This is Americana, but Americana as interpreted by Plant, Krauss and T-Bone Burnett that transcends category in a way that few albums do. Look on top. How many different categories does it rank No. 1. _ Rock, pop, folk, international. That's what music should be but too often isn't because the folks who run record companies and radio stations want to put music in the narrowest possible category.It's also a breakthrough for all three artists, including Burnett, but especially Krauss, who in her last few albums has boxed herself in with very nice listenable material that's too often predictable. A couple of the albums won Grammys(she has 20)and they're incredibly well produced and performed, but after a while one Robert Lee Castleman song turns into another and the effect is underwhelming.On this one, she uses all her talents, even, perhaps even as the excellent producer she is _ Burnett clearly took her advice and Plant's on some of the songs. Her country/bluegrass fiddle turns into gypsy violin on "Sister Rosetta,'' producing a haunting effect that's rarely heard in this kind of music.Beyond that, I've never heard an album where the voices blend so well that it's hard to tell where one stops and the other picks up _ Tom Waits' "Trampled Rose'' is the exemplar of that and the most fascinating and haunting song on the album.But it's almost all wonderful and it ends with what sounds very much like a little game being played by Burnett and Krauss in particular. The last number begins with Mike Seeger on autoharp leading into a Doc Watson gospel tune. Seeger discovered Elizabeth Cotten, who was his family's housekepper, and he was one of the pioneers who convinced record labels to record roots artists, Watson among them. It's also the most Krauss-like _ it's closest to what she does, right down to using a gospel number to close her albums (and her shows.)But most of this is totally new territory for both artists. Maybe Krauss should have gone there a decade ago or maybe the timing is perfect. It's one of the few albums _ Luncinda Williams' "Essence'' is another _ that can get away with slow tempos and minor keys on two-thirds of the songs and not sound repetitious or boring. Again, it's most important because it defies category. Other artists are trying _ Ben Harper and Norah Jones, with whom Krauss guested on a Bonnie Raitt show/CD/DVD are mingling pop, rock, country, gospel and reggae (in Harper's case.) The more the younger generation goes beyong genre and into "just music,'' the better off we'll all be. (Uh, no, Plant, at 59, isn't exactly the younger generation, but he's been looking for new frontiers for a decade or more.) He's also a Brit and Brits tend to understand American music better than most Americans. In any case, people like Mark Knopfler, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison and even Jagger/Richard stay away from boxes. (And, by the way, I just heard Krauss do a wonderful version of Winwood/Traffic's "I Can't Find My Way Home'' on XM) It was issued three years ago as part of a TV Soundtrack. So yes, she's known for a long time that there's a big wide world of music out there. This landmark album makes that point even more strongly.

Perhaps Britney was simply lowering expectations with her shenanigans over the past year, because this album is by far her best, and it is almost as if she wanted to catch everyone off guard. The entire album has an electronic vibe, moreso than hip-hop (thankfully, since hip-hop is dead), but the problem with all electronic albums (like Goldfrapp for example) is that even if the vocals, songwriting, and production are all good, the album can sound like the same song playing for 45 minutes. With this disc, this is only the case some of the time. There are three tracks (Heaven on Earth, Toy Soldier, Radar) that stand out as exceptional, but only one bad track is on the record, the dreadful "Get Naked I Got A Plan" with horrible background vocals that sound like Timbaland doing an Ozzy impersonation. There are no ballads on the disc, which is a shame because on her "Toxic" album, the best two tracks (Everytime and Shadow) were ballads. And twelve tracks is a little short for a full-length album that took years to record. On her next record, she should do a ballad and work with will i.am rather than Danja and Keri Hilson. Reason being that despite how good this record is - and it is darn good - the music will sound very outdated before long. Madonna couldn't have done it better in terms of picking better songs, but Britney needs to do an album like Madonna's "Like A Prayer" that will stand the test of time. Her fans from a near decade ago are clubbing age now and I understand why she made a 100% electro-dance record, but the fate of her big "comeback" will probably lie in a ballad similar to the ones on the "Toxic" album.

I have NO experience with classical music, nor do I wish to. It sure is not my favorite music. My ONLY exposure has been to watch "Moonstruck" 25+ times....However, when I saw Paul on TV and heard him sing, I was completely blown away.  I don't know what it is about him or the way he sings that is so captivating, but I am a fan of his now forever!!!  I just can't get enough!  Who would of thunk it?????  A million thumbs up!!

You would think it would be hard to out do a six time platinum debut such as Some Hearts, but leave it to Carrie Underwood to outdo herself once again.  Carnival Ride has more of a country sound, which for us country fans is a good thing.  It also showcases her growth as a singer.  This album has alot of songs that shows Carrie's POWERHOUSE voice.  Mark Bright returned to produce this album.  Which also proves that the two make an inseperatable team.  The first song is called FLAT ON THE FLOOR and it will get you on the dance floor stomping your feet and clapping your hands, it's a rock-country song.  Then we have the heartwarming All American Girl.  So Small of course is a great song and earns the third track.  Just A Dream is a beautiful song yet sad.  It will hit home for any military wife who has lost their husband.  Get out of this town and Crazy Dreams are both up tempo but not too fast and they are both very catchy. I KNOW YOU WON'T is a beautiful ballad about a girl who feels like she's in second place to something else.  Last name is a great song, kinda has a before he cheats kinda vibe only no cheating it's about a girl who has too much to drink and goes out and does things she would never do sober.  You Won't Find This is another great song.  I told you so is a remake of the same song by Randy Travis.  She doesn't disappoint with the final three songs either.  The More Boys I meet is a true and kinda funny song. Twisted is more pop but it's the ONLY pop song.  Finally Wheel of the world inspired the title Carnival Ride.  The entire cd is wonderful and it will get a lot of air play in my cd player. Trust me if you thought she couldn't get any better you need to listen to this album she did it again folks, prepare for more chart breaking singles, and more world breaking things from her.  I think faith hill will still be jealous of her but hey this girl is here to stay and isn't GOING ANYWHERE.

The voices are incredible and in particular the tracks, For Good and I'm Not That Girl are stellar in the vocal range of the performers!Tickets are hard to get to the Broadway show, so listening to the music is a vicarious enjoyment!

After hearing "O Holy Night" and "I'll be Home for Christmas" last year, I was disappointed that he didn't have a Christmas album out. So naturally when I saw "NOEL" had been released, I had to purchase it.As always, Josh is spectacular. But being a bit old fashioned I had hoped the music would be straight forward traditional, like his "O Holy Night" and the original "I'll be Home for Christmas". Josh has such a strong, clear, beautiful voice that can carry with little background accompaniment. But instead of emphasizing the beauty of this man's voice, many of the arrangements have him competing with the overly loud instrumental/chorus accompaniments.I would have much rather had "O Holy Night" on this CD than "The First Noel" duet with Faith Hill. As a stand alone artist Faith Hill is okay. But to pair her with Josh was a mistake. Next to him she sounds like a coyote howling in the background and is only another noisy distraction.Overall - I still have to give this five stars because it is a beautiful CD that I will listen to over and over again (yep...8 times already). I hope he puts out another one next year...but finds someone other than David Foster to arrange and produce it.

I rated this CD 5 stars because I could never give Josh anything less then 100 as I just love him, his voice and the songs on this CD! My only hang up is why did they have to have Brian Mcknight and Faith Hill sing with him? I was so shocked to hear Brian Mcknight's voice next to Josh's that I skipped the song! And Faith Hill sounds like a dying cat next to Josh's pristine voice. (At least that was my initial thought) I'm not bashing Faith as I own and love one of her CDs. Just please... Not next to Josh... I wish the producers wouldn't try to give these "trying to relive the glory days" artists new life by lumping them with someone at the peak of his career.

I love Annie Lenox, but was dissappointed in her latest CD. It just didn't seem as creative or unique as her other CD's. I was expecting something as great, or even greater than her last CD Bare. Thought this CD was just OK. Nothing special or different. Sorry Annie. I love you dearly, but this CD isn't up to your usual creative artistry.

While most older rockers release mediocre albums that get praise from hardcore listeners, Bruce keeps releasing great work.  Radio nowhere is as fun and catchy as anything he's released, the rest of the album shows a writer enjoying music, as well as working to make listeners and fans like it as well.  A great listen, and easily up to his best work.

Ok, I've bought every single cd of his since day one, loved the first and second was decent but "Noel" is such disappointment, he is very unoriginal, all the songs have same voice, starting off slowly, crescendo style to the climax and slow finish, his voice is unchallenged and  nothing new in it. And its nowhere near Chrismas, is he the first to release a xmas cd?? I don't know how else to say it but he has become extremely boring and predictable, ubelieveably dissapointing. I've purchased literally thousands of CDs but this will be Josh's last.

When I heard about this album I was very excited about the possibilities of collaboration between Allison Krauss and Robert Plant. Allison Krauss has one of the most beautiful and haunting voices around and I have especially enjoyed the duets in her previous albums. Meanwhile, in the world of psychedelic rock, Robert Plant and Led Zeppelin offer a powerful and striking uniqueness. Based on all this, I was expecting something very special, if not some fireworks, from Raising Sand.Although, the album has some very good, and at times excellent music, I am somewhat disappointed. Krauss and Plant  seem to be playing alongside each other, not as a team. When they sang together, it was in harmony, which was very subdued and dull to me. Think of mixing bright colors together and getting gray. There was none of the crisp female/male counterpoint exhibited in Allison Krauss' duets on prior albums. The first few times through the album, when either Krauss or Plant started to sing, I expected the other to come in separately and distinctly, but that never happened and I feel frustrated. The preceding criticism does not mean that this is a bad album. Technically, the instrumentals are beautiful and Allison's magnificent voice comes through many times. The best song is "Sister Rosetta Goes before Us" in which Krauss sings a mystical tune that could have been on a Led Zeppelin album. The accompanying music to this song brings a haunting effect that stays in my mind and will soon be on my IPOD. Unfortunately, nothing Plant does can come close to matching this level. Although I respect Plant very much, I feel that Krauss could have done better in choosing a music partner for a departure from her usual styles. Of course, this is just my opinion and the strengths of the album convince me to give it a weak four stars. I realize that many will dispute this review, but also know that different perspectives are what make the world interesting.

Let me preface my review with the statement that I like Paul Potts.  He has a wonderful instrument, albeit in need of some further training.  However, it is strong and clear and that overcomes many technical shortcomings.However, my lower grading is because of the nature of the album itself.First, it is extremely obvious that this CD was produced as a "strike while the iron is hot" response to Mr. Potts' amazing impact on the listening public.  Technically, it is a mishmash of poor mixing, overly loud orchestration and arrangements that sound like the vocal and orchestral arrangers weren't even in the same town, much less same room.  It appears that their marching orders were to get the CD out there on the streets, quick, before the public forgets him.Second, the power in Mr. Potts' voice is his tour de force.  With the skimpy recording techniques used and lack of response tuning, they have taken most of his best completely out, to the extent that he sounds thin in many places.Third; I must assign to whomever picked the music:  I can recall Paul, almost timidly, announcing that he was there "to sing opera" in response to Judge Amanda's question.  Then, Paul, why not do it?  Aside from Nessun Dorma, played on every PC from here to Katmandu, there was not another aria on the album!  The other music, although lovely, was what one normally finds as the; "Look, I can sing pop, too!" on operatic sampler albums.  One, maybe two, numbers, though, not the entire CD!  Was he trying to channel Il Divo and Josh Groban, or actually trying to sing opera?Hopefully, Mr. Potts is not a flash in the pan, but will continue his studies and exercise his naturally lovely voice on opera stages and in recording studios for years to come.  But, when presented with a chance like this, I do not think the producers of the CD gave him the vehicle he deserves.

Question...Can anybody explain why the 2007 release of Help was dropped? Why is this 1995 version offered in place of the new release? Could it be that Capital is promoting the Deluxe Edition so that buyers will have to pluck down an additional $80.00 so they can get the posters and other trinkets that make it a so-called "collectible"?

I don't understand why everyone is calling this "Britney's best album." Yes, she sings it, but that's pretty much the only involvement she has with it. Yes, the songs are catchy and fun, but Brit didn't write any of the songs, and had nothing to do with the music, so why should I give her any credit? ANYONE with a decent voice could have sang these songs.

I've never owned any album by Britney Spears, and had downloaded the odd track I liked in the past; "Toxic" and "Slave 4 u", and things would have stayed pretty much that way, if I hadn't read rave reviews from critics whose opinion I respect. I decided to give it a try, and surprise, I quite like it.Yes, it may be largely down to the assembled team of super producers, and their studio trickery (it features quite a bit of vocoder and vocal distortion), rather than Ms Spears' vocal prowess, but the result is rather pleasant, and guaranteed to get your feet moving.Opening is the smash hit single "Gimme more", a bouncy synth driven song with a technoi-ish sound in the chorus, and those famous opening words, "It's Britney b***". It is so catchy, I keep listening to it over and over.Other standouts are "Ooh ooh baby" (nice guitars) which is vaguely remniscent of "Toxic", the quirky Pharrell penned/produced "Why should I be sad", which is the closest thing to a ballad, "Get naked (I got a plan)", and the brilliant eurodisco stomper "Heaven on earth" which would make Giorgo Moroder smile.Some of the lyrics attempt to touch on parts on her life; "Piece of me" deals with the media obsession with her, "I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the rich and famous / You want a piece of me / I'm Mrs. Oh my God that Britney's Shameless / You want a piece of me / I'm Mrs. Extra! Extra! this just in / You want a piece of me", while on the skeletal marching groove of the Gwen Stefani-ish "Toy soldiers" she seems to diss her ex, stating that "This time she needs a real soldier, and she's sick and tired of toy soldiers".If she keeps releasing music this good, she just might succeed in blacking out all the negative press! A fun record which succeeds. Should easily be Britney's 5th #1 album.

Count me a NEW FAN ! Annie Lennox has always been on the edge of my listening taste , but I decided to check this new album out and I am so glad I did !! I am sooo.. Impressed by the writing, the incredible vocals, the mix and production. I see Glen Ballard has a hand in this and It sure didn't hurt ! Every song a gem.. One of the best ( if not the best ! ) albums I have purchased and listened to ( again and again ) this year ! DO BUY THIS ONE !!  A new fan.....

For all those that are bashing this CD, you have to remember that Rob and his pals decided not to release a new CD for a while so they could get ahead in other aspects of life. (Rob wanted to spend some more time with his wife among other things and reasons). But before you complain too much again, remember that during the wait, Rob Thomas released his album SOMETHING TO BE as well as  performed for MEET THE ROBINSONS and was seen on several reviews etc.No, there is no good reason to complain. Every person has a right to get away for a little while and do something a little different. So if you are complaining about the artists and not the songs(specifically) go jump off a lake, because the artists have a right to live a life THEY want, not the life you want them to live.

This is a wonderful CD by Bruce Springsteen, with the welcome and accomplished backing by the E Street Band.  He has not worked with this group so much over the past two decades.  But the partnership here richly pays off in this latest work by Springsteen.  There is a sensibility to this album that hearkens back to earlier classics, such as "Born to Run" and "Born in the USA" and Darkness on the Edge of Town."A few cuts illustrate the tonality of this work.The CD begins with a classic up tempo rocker, "Radio Nowhere," that one will easily remember after having listened to it.  The E Street Band does great work here.  The guitar work, for instance, is terrific (the band features the following on guitar, Springsteen, of course, the redoubtable Stevie Van Zandt, and the talented Nils Lofgren). A couple lines say it all:"This radio nowhereIs there anybody alive out there?. . . .I just want to hear some rhythm. . . .I want a thousand guitarsI want pounding drums"Another interesting cut is "Livin' in the Future," which has its predecessors on other CDs from his period with the E Street Band.  The E Street Band here does its work in its own inimitable style.  Clemons sax work is as advertised.  Some of the suggestive and evocative lines:"A letter come blowin' in on an ill windSomethin' `bout me and you Never seein' one another again.. . . .Don't worry darlin',Now baby don't you fretWe're livin' in the future andNone of this has happened yet.""Girls in Their Summer Clothes" is a bittersweet song.  Some gloom here: "And tonight I'm gonna burn this town down," "Things been a little tight, but I know they're gonna turn my way" [a negative thought, but then an optimistic note, a telling recurring theme in Springsteen's corpus], and "Love's a fool's dance."  There is some great imagery about a diner.Then, "Magic." There are interesting images of magic, with some modest sense of foreboding.  This is a soft, almost hypnotic, tune."Long Walk Home."  This begins with a plaintive note:"Last night I stood at your doorstepTrying to figure out what went wrong."This is another song about a home town, evoking recollections of earlier of his songs on the same theme.  Once more, vivid images of his home town abound. There is a gritty realism to the lyrics, reinforced by the music itself. Great work by the E Street Band, with special mention for the sax and guitar playing.And, then, as sometimes happens in CDs these days--an untitled song not listed on the "liner notes."  There are interesting references to art works, engineering feats, and someone who "broke the mold." This is more akin to his recent acoustic and folk CDs.  An interesting piece.So, how to rate this work?  If you like the Springsteen of the glory days of his alliance with the E Street Band, you'll enjoy this CD.  It works very well and is a good addition to his oeuvre.

When I saw the first song was "Silent Night," I must admit I thought, "Well, Josh has a very nice voice but `Silent Night' is pretty much the same whoever sings it."  Well!  I was so very wrong.  I've never heard an interpretation as emotionally impacting as Josh Groban's rendition.  It literally moved me to tears.  Wonderful ... amazing.As I listened to the rest of the songs on "Noel," I found each one to be surprisingly "new" in his performance.  He brought life to "The Little Drummer Boy" that I had never heard in this song.  And "I'll be Home for Christmas?"  Oh my.  With the tracks of our troops commenting to friends and families back home, I was actually sobbing.  What an amazing gift he has, not only have a voice that lingers in my mind but such sincerity and drama in each performance.  He truly seems to "feel" the lyrics.  Josh Groban is a miraculous talent.Before I had finished listening, I decided to send "Noel" out instead of Christmas cards this year.  I want all of my family and friends to have this CD.My husband doesn't listen to much music either, but I had him sit alone at my computer and listen to "Noel."  When I heard it finishing and came back to the room, he was wiping away tears as well.  Oh my goodness, what a wonderful thing Josh Groban has done.

First off the tracks are up beat and catchy! Yeah For Brit! But Where is the slow songs...? Missing! Is it cuz she cant sing high notes so she chooses song that show case no vocal ability or is it that she was to wrapped up in her life to actually notice there was no slow songs...She shows no growth as a Performer (Not Artist) on this album from the last. in fact since the CD "Britney" she has the same sound and same subjects. It rather boring after awhile. Artist in her Peer Group like Christina Aguilera and Beyonce have evolved both of there sounds. Christina has a Blue old school R&B Feel and Beyonce has created a sound of her own. Also, They both co write every track on their albums. Britney still lacks the Artist quality with only co writing part of the songs and still no vocals. Strange that she based her career off stage performance and as shown at the VMAS she can't do that anymore. What's Left but a over the top pop album that has the appeal of a sophomore CD Sound. Grow up Brit become an artist no a hopeless performer who still lip-syncs all her shows. Bottom line, if you like her Cds Of the past get the Album, if your expecting a more Mature Brit your be disappointed. Just a quick question, Does it seem to anyone else that from her performance at the VMAS, blowing off big named producers like Timbo and Justin, and Neyo, to The Cds Album Art to the Video for "Gimme More" to the Album itself... that Brit is putting little to no effort to this sorry project? Her fans now are living in the past. She is not the same Britney from three years ago. Let it Go!

I'm one of those die-hard Annie Lennox fans that has bought every solo and Eurythmics CD (or cassette) released since I first laid ears on "Sweet Dreams" at the age of 13 -- until "Bare" and now "Songs of Mass Destruction" came out.  Don't get me wrong -- she still has the most beautiful voice I have ever heard but her last two albums have fallen flat for me.  I understand that artists change with time and, as a result, so does their work but that doesn't mean they always change for the better.  I don't think Annie has lost her passion as I can still sense that in her music.  She just doesn't convey it as well as she used to.  Annie's voice is so ethereal -- so above the rest of us mere mortals -- that to mix it with what can best be described as a more mainstream sound is to diminish it.  That's how this CD feels to me.  It seems like Annie is no longer experimenting or pushing musical boundaries any more.  I admit I do like her best as the cold, distant Ice Queen (something Dave Stewart exploited quite well) but I guess that's because said persona suits her sound best: Untouchable.  Looking at my iTunes ratings today, one can see how a lifetime of listening to Ms Lennox has evolved for me.  Most of her commercial hits ("Here Comes the Rain Again," "Why" and "No More 'I Love You's'" being exceptions) rate three stars or lower while obscure songs like, "Jennifer," "Aqua" and "Savage" endure with five stars, still haunting me to this day.  Annie Lennox is at her best when she's subtle -- insidiously slipping through your personal defenses with her siren melodies until, before you realize it, she has pierced straight through your soul.  Unfortunately, "Mass Destruction", while technically sound, well produced and well performed, has all the subtlety of a sledge hammer by comparison.  I want her to taunt, tease and tantalize yet remain painfully aloof.  I say bring back the Diva, Annie.  Nobody hurt oh-so-good as she did.

I too was anxiously awaiting release of this album. I was worried that it was gonna be too Zepplinesque, despite the fact that I was a serious Zeppelin fan in the 70's. Between that and loving Alison Krauss I had to get this album. Having come back to my folk roots where I originally started and then morphing into country and bluegrass, I had hoped that this would be more mellow and accoustic than rock and roll and wasn't sure where the blend of these two voices would meet. It is mellow and beautiful, and in several songs, I love Plant's "hints" of his signature scream that he does so well. In an accoustic setting, Plant's perfect voice stands out more, and the two voices blend like a chorus of angels. Besides the curiousity of what these 2 icons of different genres would create together, I was also drawn to this album for "Killin" the Blues", written by my good friend Rowland Salley. I loved this song from way back, when Roly was the only one that sang it. Now many have recorded it. It is a fantastic song and was always one of my favorites. I think it is one of the best songs on the album along with "Your Long Journey".  There are many other great tunes on this disc and the harmonies are impeccable. Someone else mentioned that they were bothered by the song where Alison sings in the male vernacular. The song is great and very Alison Krauss style, but I also wish she would have sung it true to her gender. Regardless, I still love that song, love the album and am glad to have it in my collection. The album grows on me the more I hear it, but I liked it from the first listen.

What an amazing collaborative effort...and not just Krause and Plant who are amazing togethere but T Bone Burnett and the entire ensemble...less is really more...the melodies are 'haunting' and the arrangements are incredible. The voices 'blend' and we are talking about MORE than a mere "duet" album here. Well-done.

Springsteen's Crystal clear voice is filled with emotion and feeling. The songs are well chosen. The music is really terrific. I love this CD. It's some great music that gets you in all sorts of moods. On some of the tracks you'll notice that the guitar and other instruments sort of drown out his voice. And a few songs seem to be in the same range and that makes him sound a bit monotone. His anti-war views are prominent on his new album. This may or may not be off setting to some. Most of the tracks are great. His voice has a richness that you have to love. It's a voice that's lived.

I am by no means a die-hard Bruce fan, and in fact only started to listen to him with any focus a year after Born to Run came out - I was initially repelled by the cover-of-Time, "the next Dylan" kind of baloney that was heaped on him at the time. But as the years went by, I acquired more and more appreciation for his passion and what I came to finally accept is his true persona, a man who is struggling to find meaning in a world that is unpredictable, unfair, and often brutal but who manages to find enough beauty to stave off despair and continue the search.Having said that, I bought this album a week ago and have been playing it at least once a day all the way through, and I think this is a classic. The comments I've read here about the abysmal production completely baffle me - and I didn't even buy the commercial CD, I downloaded it from  iTunes and burned my own copy. I think the production does a fantastic job of highlighting the melodies, which are consistently beautiful and interesting, track to track. Bruce's voice has never sounded better, and the lyrics are just opaque enough to lend some mystery and bite to the proceedings. My only quibble is that, without the printed lyric sheets, some of the words are hard to make out, and listeners trying to decipher them on their own may miss some of the more intriguing content.I've been listening to music fervently and closely since I was nine years old, and one of the somewhat perverse pleasures I've experienced over time has been the satisfaction of seeing trivial, contrived, and pretentious recordings and performers fade away as their "sell-by" date comes and goes. And conversely, I love that teenagers are still buying Hendrix albums (not to mention Led Zeppelin and Creedence). This recording will be bought and listened to for years to come, too.

This is a so-so album. I don't think they've put out a great album since "There is nothing left to Lose", although "One By One" has some incredible moments. Each of their first three albums had songs that were individually original and unique. "One by One", although enjoyable, gave me the feeling they were slipping just a bit, and then "In Your Honor" came out, and the first disc of heavy songs all sounded the same. Buried lyrics, searing guitar riffs, and repetitive choruses. Nothing stood out. It seemed like "Butter spread upon too much bread" (quoting J.R.R. Tolkien). I feel the same way about many of the songs on this new album; the rocking songs just kind of sit there and do nothing. Plus they are mixing the acoustical side B of "In your Honor" with the second half of this album, and it leaves an imperfect, unbalanced effort between fast and slow. "Summer's End" is my favorite track, for it at least has a groove, an in-between, which lacks on other songs that don't have anything to sick your teeth into. Speaking of sinking teeth, Dave lacks the hunger he used to have. It all sounds much too comfortable. Standard rock, at best. Side of fries. Check, please.

Trick or treat with Britney Spears! Britney pops up just in time for Halloween with "Blackout," not only is this her first studio CD in 4 years but it's also one of her very best yet! Her voice sounds perfect on all of the tracks; much more mature and grown-up than on prior CD's. The lyrics are strong because on this record Britney has a lot more to say. She's not the girl next-door anymore. No, this Britney is strong and in control and doesn't need any man to tell her what to do! Besides the lead single, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W4HFXO">Gimme More</a>, I also love "Peace of Me" and "Hot As Ice" because she sounds so amazing on these tracks. Admit it you know you like her. Or, just like everyone else you're fascinated with her and can't get enough of Britney. There's something about Britney that manages to constantly draw people to her. It's like Britney is a satellite that transfers light to millions of people all over the world through her musical energy!

All I can say is......wow.  As a longtime Springsteen fan, this is a tremendous collection of songs.  I think this is the best collection of Bruce songs since The River.  This CD rocks.  As a true great CD should, the more you listen, the better it gets.  I'd list my favorite songs, but it really is almost all of them.  Awesome.  And of course - the E Street band is tremendous as always.

The Beatles in HELP is over 40 years old..and it is as fresh as it was 40 years ago. This  two disk DVD  version is a classic film, restored to its glory that modern day marvels can do to film. This pre-MTV film stands as a great blend of music and comedy. The Beatles music in the film may seem new to the young ones. Nevertheless,  I would not be surprised if the HELP soundtrack goes back up the top 40 with the DVD releaseRichard Lester, who was director of the 1973/74 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006LPC5">The Complete Musketeers (The Three Musketeers / The Four Musketeers)</a>, moved the Beatles in this fast paced romp, like the Marx Brothers did 40 years before them. Lester did what was later done for TV with the MONKEES. MTV called Lester "The Father of MTV" due to the movie HELP...which he replied that he wanted a blood testThe film looked like nonsense, but it has a thin plot about Ringo and a special ring. Leo (Rumpole of the Bailey, The Prisoner) McKern and Roy (Three Musketeers) Kinear ham it for the camera in this romp. This is a simple enjoyable film is one of these that  family can watchThe two disk set also has a 16 page booklet with mostly pictures and very little text (if you are a film buff, I suggest you buy the deluxe HELP set with Richard Lester's annotated script book) . The booklet reminds me of a movie book, that was sold in the theaters when a large film was release..I have a few from Ben Hur and the Ten Commandments...BOY I AM DATING MYSELF NOW!What is missing for me is Lester or the remaining Beatles (Paul & Ringo) doing an audio commentary over the film. The second disk has a few documentaries, but no comments from neither Paul nor Ringo..and that is a shame! Now, what you all want to know is, IS IT WORTH IT?  YES, it is a still a grand piece of comedy and music that is timelessSo you don't need HELP to get this film..Just order it and get the HELP you need!Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD

Disappointing.  Songs sound very similar - does she not have a band?  What is country with out some picking. All songs are in the shrill tone - no variety.  Look for mine in the used section.

Having listened to it on the radio, now without all the talk around the tracks, I have greatly enjoyed the collection of songs and arrangements.  Bruce's voice sounds stronger and more melodic than ever; it shows emotion and depth.  Quite the magical hour.

This cd is an abuse of Substance!  I LOVE IT ! Kid Rock grows with us and takes us along for the ride. Rock'n Roll Jesus is awesome! Amen is heartbreakingly true.  All Summer Long takes us outside, remembering how we used to enjoy the evenings hanging out in cars, at parks & lakes, long before the Internet!  (This song takes me back to a better time~Eastwood Lake!)  The show at the Taft in Cincinnati was great as well -can't wait for the Arena tour.  Rock'n Roll Jesus -Testify, It's a Rock Revival!  I've missed him so much, and I'm damn glad he's back!  Love ya Rock!

I can see where some reviewers on here would judge this CD harshly...they are expecting Annie to churn out the same thing over and over just to satisfy them when she has always put out albums that reflect her own vision to satisfy her own creativity, not to satisfy fans or people who expect another Bare(you know who you are), Diva, Sweet Dreams, or Here Comes the Rain Again. Those days are gone, people, get over it.  Ms. Lennox has put out another fine effort that showcases fine production, song writing, and of course her fabulous voice that seems to get better with each CD, if that's even possible.  I just listened to it for the first time and actually my favorite is Dark Road, but I'm sure as I keep listening to it closer new favorites will emerge.  Annie is never going to please everybody, and she never will, but those of us who appreciate a true artist who writes her own lyrics and music and performs it beautifully every time and doesn't listen to critics, record execs or whining fans gets my love and respect every time!  You go, Diva!

Annie's new album is just okay mainly because the songs fail to move me like others she's put out.I suppose they'll take some time to grow on me as opposed to her album "Bare" that I instantly loved the first time I listened to it.Time will tell on this new one...

John Fogerty delivers on Revival, demonstrating once again that he is a consumate rock guitarist and lyricist worthy of his icon status but there just weren't any stand out tunes and it doesn't stand up to his previous Blue Moon Swamp.

Sometimes the vocals get buried in the thickness of the production.  Some of it is almost Spector-esque.  I bet the next pressing may be modified.  That acknowledged, I think this is a very good album that is still growing on me.  He does sound young again.  Really happy Terry's Song made it on last minute.  For the folks giving this 1 or 2 stars...err...that's inconceivable.  3 at the very least.  Find out for yourself.  I'm very happy with it.

I have lots of Christmas albums, and love them all, but this is the best yet!!! I've been waiting all of Josh's career for him to come out with a Christmas CD, and it was well worth the wait. Just beautiful!! My personal favorite is 'I'll Be Home for Christmas', with all the messages from our brave men & women fighting far from home. What a wonderful interpretation of that song!!! There are no bad ones, that's just my favorite! I'm already playing it a lot, and it's only October, but I don't think I'll be getting tired of it. May be playing it next July! You can't go wrong with this one!

2008 is Britney Spears year...if she promotes this wonderful album well! We all have a bad year(s), and she NEEDS a break! Reuniting with her family is maybe THE key for her to keep a well state of mind, and she's done that...the other factor would be a great, hypnotizing, addicting album...and she's done that too! She has things going for her again, and i hope she gives her all!Highly recommend this album!!!!!!

I bought this cd because my friends had been raving about it so much. When I put it on, at first I didn't know what to think. To help, I looked up the storyline of the musical, and then I got the songs. By knowing the story, I could actually hear the charcters joys, triumphs, and pains. And I feel in love with the music. This soundtrack is one of my favorites, thanks to the amazing score and the talent of these singers. I was lucky enough to see Wicked a few weeks ago, and I was even more memorized. I recommend the show immensely, but if you don't get to the show, buy the soundtrack! Here are the songs reviewed:1. No One Mourns the Wicked 6/10: A great opening number, but      unless you see the show it may seem a little random. It does show of Kristin Chenowith's amazing vocal range.2. Dear Old Shiz 3/10: An ok song, but I like how they say Shizzzz in it- funny!3. The Wizard and I 10/10: An amazing song! Our first glimpse into Elphaba, and Idina Menzel just sings her heart out!4. What is This Feeling 9/10: I love how they have two choruses singing as one in this song. It's hilarious in the play, with Galinda and Elphaba venting about their feelings. 5. Something Bad 5/10: listen to this song once in a while, just to remember what's happening. I also love the dangerous undertones in the music. 6. Dancing Through Life 8/10: Such a fun one to sing to! Fiyero's voice just soothes the soul. 7.  Popular 8/10: Galinda's ballid. And by that, I mean a wonderfully shallow, bubblegum pop anthem. 8. I'm Not That Girl 7/10: You can literally hear Elphaba's heart breaking in this one. It's a beatiful, simple song that shows off Menzel's mid-level range. 9. One Short Day 6/10: Much better to see visually. But it's fun to listen to on the soundtrack. 10. Sentimental Man 5/10: Very short, with nothing really great to make it worth listening to. 11. Defying Gravity 15/10: I know that's not possible, but it's just that good! The best song on the soundtrack, and the best scene in the play. 12. Thank Goodness 8/10: A song that I listened to over and over again. You can also hear Glinda finally growing as a person. 13. Wonderful 6/10: The best of the Wizard's songs. Fun tempo to it. 14. I'm not That Girl (reprise): Good, but more of a prelude to the next song. 15. As long as you're Mine 10/10: A great love song. Fiyero and Elphaba sing great together. 16. No Good Deed 10/10: So sad, because you know that Elphaba has decided to be Wicked. But I just love how Menzel sings this. 17. March of the Witch Hunters 7/10: Not a stand out, but the intensity of the chorus is great. 18. For Good 9/10: A tearjerker. Glinda and Elphaba saying goodbye to each other 19. Finale 9/10: A great way to sum up the musical. When you see it live, it gives you chills. Well, there you have it. Now go buy Wicked!

For more than a quarter century as a fan of Bruce Springsteen, I could expect a new album to have virtually no weaknesses. This time around, the whole thing is a disappointment. The sound is mediocre and muddy. Lyrically, he's getting brownie points for the political bent of several of these songs. Very poor, in my opinion. In fact, this may rank at the very bottom of the Springsteen canon. What's really striking is how uninspired this thing sounds next to the brilliant Live in Dublin.

Iron and Wine has done it again! As good as this album is, I hope they stay true to who they are and not turn too commercial.  The biggest appeal to these guys is the down to earth simplicity that Sam and the crew possesses. The music is a work of art.  Don't pass on this one.

Potts is essentially untrained, unpolished, inexperienced in performance under pressure, obviously somewhat tired and emotionally drained and rushed into a fast recording session to meet marketing demands to get the product out while he's "hot."  (A really serious recording session would have taken a couple of weeks, at the least.)And who cares?  I've read both the Brit and US reviews.  Most have it right.  This is a man with so much HEART it spills over into ours.  I, too, had a fifty year singing career professionally.  I was good, more than good enough to work steadily.  But I don't know that I never touched so many hearts, made so many thrill, caused so many tears to blossom on cheeks as has this young guy in one or two performances.  Bravissimo! say's I.  And I hope that he gets both a high quality agent and vocal teacher who can lead him into the greatness he deserves and prevent the excesses which happens far too often in the music business aimed only at profit.Paul Potts is best of us, one who dreams and KNOWS he dreams.  This is what greatness is created from.  Not only greatness for this individual, bless him, but greatness for the rest of us who watch as a dream came true and are shown that it is POSSIBLE!!!  (I'm over 70 and Potts has got me singing again, something I thought I'd left behind!.  It feels  WONDERFUL!!!)His performances were nothing less than magic and he drew millions into his dream, showed us that we truly can touch the stars if we hang on to that dream.As for those critics and detractors who cannot get out of their heads and pick away at unimportant details, the ones who have long ago lost their own ability to dream, I can only feel horrible pity for them.  They long ago disconnected from their hearts to hide their own hurts and disappointments.  SING ON, Paul!  I look forward to many more heart ringing performances from you.  The Queen is going to be blessed when you sing for her.  As you are blessed and have blessed all of us.

You know what to expect from a Foo Fighters album: catchy riffs, belted out choruses, and some acoustic guitar here and there.  Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace has all that and a little more.1.	The Pretender 10/10:  This song was amazing the first time I heard it, but subsequent listens made me realize there really isn't more to it than I heard on the first listen.  It's still a really great rock song, very radio friendly.2.	Let It Die 9/10:  Following in the steps of "February Stars" and other Foo Fighters songs that start soft and end screaming, this song would be perfect if the lyrics weren't so repetitive.3.	Erase/Replace 6/10:  I didn't like this one the first time I heard it.  The verses aren't bad, but the chorus really doesn't work.  It is starting to grow on me a bit though.4.	Long Road to Ruin 7/10:  These days, subtle war songs work better than obvious ones, and this song works; I suppose.5.	Come Alive 8/10:  The "Come Alive" constantly in the background toward the end help to ruin the potential this song had to be one of the Foo Fighters' best.  The demo version on "The Pretender" single isn't as good as this album version, just in case you were planning on buying "The Pretender" single.6.	Stranger Things Have Happened 9/10:  Gee, you think Dave likes to smoke?  Though rather mellow, it's a very catchy song.7.	Cheer Up Boys (Your Make Up Is Running) 8/10:  Makeup is one word.  While we're at it, there should be a comma after "Patience" in the album's title, and no comma after "But" in "But, Honestly."8.	Summer's End 9/10:  The classic rock influence is very obvious here.  The lyrics have the same meaninglessness as the Foo Fighters' first album, but it's still an enjoyable song.9.	The Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners 2/10:  An acoustic instrumental, yeah... that's why you buy a Foo Fighters album.10.	Statues 5/10:  It's an okay song, but it's just not my thing.11.	But, Honestly 6/10:  It's an okay song, but it's nothing special.12.	Home 3/10:  This one is way too artsy.  Much like "Friend of a Friend" from the last album, it attempts to impose a greatness that it really doesn't have.In general, this album has two weak points:*	Some of the songs just aren't very captivating, namely the last four*	Just about all of the songs are rather repetitive, but that's nothing newIt's still a really good album, and it's rather versatile, but it's not really a legitimate candidate for the Foo Fighters' best.

I work in a retail establishment and often saw customers wearing black "Wicked" t-shirts.  One day I asked about the show and, hearing it was good, I decided to buy the CD.  I am a big fan of musicals and was excited to explore something new to me. When the CD arrived I immediately popped it into my computer. The music exceeded my expectations.  The score is full of energy and drama and I greatly enjoy singing along.  Idina Menzel's voice is so spectacular (as Elphaba) I can't get enought of it!  Kristin Chenoweth (as Galinda) has a quirky but likeable voice and the rest of the cast is strong as well.  Although I was able to glean bits of  the story line from the music, I have decided to read the book now to fill in the gaps.  I hope to see the actual show when it comes my way in August!  This CD is a MUST HAVE for all musical lovers and should become a "classic" over time.

This one takes you back to what you liked about "the Boss" in the first place.  Every song eventually grows on you and you find yourself singing them all the time.  I think every song on this CD could see some airtime on the radio.  Its just very well done and well worth buying.

Boy oh boy! This one is just great. I haven't been so pleased with an album in a long time. One of the other reviews made a comment that it was like listening to CCR again. I found the same thing to be true. You can hear so much of that CCR sound in these songs. That is if you were really a CCR fan and listened to all of the songs on the old albums. Those who remember just the hits might not have the same feelings that I do, but the sound and the lyrics are just top notch Creedence. My favorite is 'Creedence Song' but they're all good. Typical are some commentaries on society which really hit the mark, especially for those that might be called 'the silent majority'. Well done, John. Well done.

Annie  has come up with a real cracker, a collection of songs which, while steeped in the bleak lyrical outlook of their creator, a woman who seems destined to yearn, weep and howl at the moon, is nevertheless beautiful and rich and stirring.There's a whole lifetime of experience crammed into this thing, and Lennox's voice has never sounded better - in the lower registers it's like seasoned teak, then it soars into an icy stratosphere."For her fourth solo outing, Annie Lennox has ditched her usual producer, Stephen Lipson, in favour of Glen Ballard, the American best known for inflicting Alanis Morissette upon the world. While there's no denying the power and command of Lennox's vocals throughout, it's not a particularly fruitful alliance, Ballard's bland sound denuding the songs of impact. Alarm bells really start ringing two-thirds of the way through, when one realises that "Coloured Bedspread" is just about the most enjoyable thing here, precisely because its understated Eighties electro-funk so closely resembles her work in Eurythmics. The rest of the album vacillates between sludgy power ballads, such as "Smithereens" and "Lost", and Elton-esque MOR rockers, such as "Love is Blind". The Aids-benefit anthem "Sing" struggles to make much impression despite a choir comprised of virtually every popular female singer in the Western world, and a few from beyond.Lennox's greatest failing throughout "Songs of Mass Destruction" is her too-eager recourse to lyrical clich, a parade of banalities every bit as clunky as that title".Andy Gill.She, it's easy to forget, is one of the greatest singers that Britain has ever produced. She can purr softly, reach high notes that only the uber-divas of the nineties (Celine Dion, Regina Belle, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey) normally attempt."Dark Road", the first single from "Songs of Mass Destruction" - only her third album of original material in a decade and a half - is a timely reminder of the Scottish songstress' awesome vocal chops.Over portentous, melancholy piano chords, Lennox croons world-weary, slightly ambiguous lyrics - "Maybe I'm still searchin' but I don't know what it means, all the fires of destruction are still burnin' in my dreams" - with tenderness and restraint. Its melody grows in stature with every spin, while its tumultuous, strutting middle eight feels like the smashing vase that ends the bitter sulk of a domestic dispute.The album is Lennox at her haunting best, with the sort of velvet vocals your average female singer would mud-wrestle her granny for.Lennox demonstrates yet again, if proof was still needed, she's one of the most iconic divas of our time, someone to be treasured and revered. No matter what new path she treads in her career, she turns it into her own and proceeds to dazzle even the most hardened of critics.   Highlights : "Coloured Bedspread", "Dark Road",and "Smithereenes"

This video is one of the funniest I've ever seen. With all of my fave guys of course I would say that, but if your a Beatles fan you have to watch this video with Ringo, Paul, George, and John. Even if you aren't you should also. This isn't one of their best but it is really close.

That line is from Bob Dylan's song "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues".  I thought it was appropriate because I am truly grateful to Annie Lennox for the passion and attitude she has created in the recording studio for the last 25 years, both as one of The Eurythmics and as a solo artist, accent on the word "artist".  This time around, Annie presents us with a mixture of confessional ballads and harder, dancier tracks, all written by the Lady herself."Dark Road" starts out pretty bland but has a strong mid-section reminiscent of Eurythmics music.  Likewise, "Smithereens" thankfully grows in strength as the song progresses.  "Through the Glass Darkly" and "Lost" are ballads that I like better because they lean toward the dark side musically.  Unfortunately, one of the ballads is the least successful track;  "Fingernail Moon" despite being a pretty song with the usual good, creative arrangement, seems to be a strain on Annie's voice.So you've probably guessed that I prefer the up-tempo tracks, and you are right.  "Love Is Blind" sounds like it could have been lifted straight from the "Touch" album.  "Ghosts In My Machine" rocks like "Missionary Man" right from the start.  "Womankind", a driving dance track, reminds me of "Take Me to the River" from "Medusa", and "Big Sky" sounds like a dramatic R&B song Annie-style, again like the ones on "Medusa".  "Coloured Bedspread" is one of the best, with interesting lyrics and tight, hard dance music.  And "Sing" is another synth-dance cut, accompanied by prominent piano which reminds me of 90's Club music.Now don't get the idea that I don't like the ballads.  I just prefer the up-tempo tracks, and if a song has to be a ballad, I'd rather it be dark and moody than light and sunny.  The fact is, Annie once again has released a classy, well-produced work that we should all appreciate in this time of scarce good music.

While I see some of the purists on Amazon have registered dissatisfaction with the new sounds on Sam Beam's latest Iron and Wine adventure, to me, it just seems like he has found new ways to decorate the core sound. The remains of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006J402">The Creek Drank the Cradle</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ENX54">Our Endless Numbered Days</a> are firmly in place: the smoky melodies and music, existential lyrics, and the breathy voice that floats above it all. But on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00070DLAO">Woman King</a> EP and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AMJD8I">In the Reins</a> collaboration with Calexico, you could see Beam pressing against the bubble."The Shepard's Dog" is the summation of that restlessness. The trademarks are all still there (as the opening line/title of this review attests), but Beam has added more colors to his palette. In addition to a broader array of traditional acoustic instruments, more electric and eclectic sounds have made their way into the studio. There is the experimental build-up that climaxes "Wolves" or the vocoder that adds a sixties feel to "Carousel," he's following his muse down fresh paths. If that scares you a bit, fear not. "Pagan Angel and a Borrowed Car" and the finale, "Flightless Bird, American Mouth" will bring those who idolized "Our Endless Numbered Days" to swoon with delight. Along with Devandra Banhart's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UGG33M">Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon</a>, "The Shepherd's Dog" is the second great folk album of 2007.

...then you'll love the CD.  By now, more people have seen a cast *other* than the original, so it won't be exactly the way you might remember it.  I've come to the conclusion, after much listening and  YouTube surfing that the original cast was - if not the best - at least tied with the best, particularly the leads.

I think we can now add Kid Rock to the heartland rockers club. This is by far the best album he has ever made. Who ever did not give this album 5 stars is smoking something and needs to get off of it please. It has everything. A little rock, rap, blues, and country. i bought this album and it still has not been taken out of my cd player.. yes its that good. If you like Mellencamps jack and diane, Segers night moves, or Springsteens born to run, you will love Kid Rocks song "all summer long" it is my fav. one on the cd. Its a take you back to your first love tpye of song. To be truefull there is not a bad song on this album. And i was never a big Kid Rock fan. Mellencamp has always been my fav. but after this album i can say Kid Rock is in my top five and moving up. This is his peak album so far. Mellencamp had "1985s Scarecrow", Springsteen had "1984s Born In The USA", Seger had "1976s Night Moves" and now Kid Rock has "2007 Rock N Roll Jesus". It is classic rock and roll at its best with a bit of rap/country. Move over boys, its time to let Kid Rock join the heartland rockers club!!!

"Blackout" is a great album! The producers Nate "Danja" Hills and the Swedish duo Bloodshy & Avant did a fabulous job putting together Britney's comeback release. I've never been a huge fan of electro-pop but the style happens to be what makes Blackout a music sensation. The lyrics closely mirror her life and the music mixes are top notch.  If you loved the single "Toxic," you'll love this entire album.I can't help but ask myself, after seeing her on the MTV Music Awards, whether or not she can carry this album with a tour, which needs to be done because that's what Britney's career was built on. All in all, there isn't anything bad about this album.  It's Britney at her finest, personal life aside.

I am NOT a fan of Country music, but this album is awesome! Carrie Underwood's voice is amazing. She displays such a range, not just vocally, but also emotionally. And on top of all that, she is beautiful!

With a sound hearkening back to his seventies/eighties heyday; loads of harmonica, organ, lovely harmonies, poetic lyrics, and those fiery guitars, "Magic" by Bruce Springsteen is just that, Magic! It became deservedly his 8th #1 album on the Billboard charts, and his seventh in the UK.Opening cut, "Radio nowhere" is a burst of brilliance, with lyrics about being lost and unable to find anyone around. It is destined to be a stadium classic. Other rockers include the cheery horn sprinkled "Livin' in the future" (which reminds me a wee bit of "Cover me"), "Girls in their summer clothes", "Last to die", and "Long walk home" (which starts off deceptively gentle, and builds up to a galloping rocker).On the softer side of things are the beautiful cinematic acoustic ballad "Magic" (lovely mandolin, and gently sweeping strings), the brooding "Devil's arcade", and closing cut, the acoustic/hymnal "Terry's song" (lovely mournful harmonica solo), a heartfelt lament for a departed long time assistant.I have to agree with lots of reviewers who have commented on the poor sound quality in mixing the CD. Still, a truly magical collection from The Boss, who has been rocking for well over 30 years.

Matchbox 20 really  did have a very special place in music industry and in music itself, great artists, but this greatest hits cover up with 6 not great songs is really a let down from a band that brought mad season and yourself or someone like you... adding that now four, it's not the same feeling as b 4... I really look up and cherish bands that retire with success in their path and say good bye at the top.. not bands that start to fall down in quality and feelings... sad season to be remembered!!

Okay, turn off your brain and buy this ticket to a very fun ride.  It made a Beatles fan of me (I'm 21)and I loved seeing all the lame and funny gags before either Monty Python or Peter Sellers got hold of them.  The Fab Four were gloriously homely and utterly cute as the stumbled, deadpanned and goofed their way through this extremely silly film.  And just when you're gasping from trying to groan and laugh at the same time, a beautiful song comes to save the day.  All the stars in the sky to this one.

NO doubt about it. This is BRITNEY'S most accomplished collection of recordings ever. It's hip, stylized, fresh and current. Do not be fooled by Britney's antics, she has proved with BLACKOUT that she can still stay relevant in the music industry and is a major force to be reckoned with. BRITNEY FANS (and HATERS) buy this album. Everyone can agree that Britney is the undisputed queen of pop, and this album proves it. We'll see you at number one BRIT!

i'm a big fan of CCR and was psyched to see a new Fogerty album, but this pathetic collection of anti-war tunes is just plain lame.  i thought a talented musician with the history and cred of Fogerty was above this sort of thing, but I guess not.  do we really need more anti-war albums?  it's getting about as old as the war itself.  come on people, it's not vietnam, stop trying to recreate the "protest 60's" it ain't happening!

Matchbox Twenty's lyrics on Exile on Mainstream's six new tracks are universally felt. The music is upbeat for most of the tracks, and the lyrics are dark in true MB20 fashion. The themes of Exile all have to do with relationships and seem to be discontent, uncertainty, regret and the inability to make amends. As they say, hindsight is 20/20. Kind of like waking up one day and thinking, `What is my life all about?' And then trying to make peace with what you've created. "These Hard Times" has the classic MB20 sound and is sure to please. "How Far We've Come" and "I'll Believe You When" are played in part during Monday Night Football.The new tracks on Disc 1 are:1.	"How Far We've Come" is a shout-out to reassess your contribution to the world.2.	"I'll Believe You When" deals with the frustration of trying to prove you've changed.  Then, trying to make amends to no avail and considering moving on to someone else?3.	"All Your Reasons" is about coming to that point in a relationship when one realizes, `I don't need this crap! Why don't you just go away?' 4.	"These Hard Times" is about mourning something/someone when you really didn't want to let go but know there wasn't any other way to continue.5.	"If I Fall" deals with continually falling short and asking for help.6.	"Can't Let You Go" is about trying to hold on to someone who's part of your soul.Disc 2 contains the greatest hits and is a fabulous collection although it feels incomplete because, as most MB20 fans will agree, the complete collection would be every track MB ever recorded!Front man Rob Thomas performs outstanding vocals, and drummer Paul Doucette moved to guitar and does a superb job.  Another fabulous album from a legendary band. This devoted fan is super satisfied.If you're one of the few that haven't experienced Matchbox Twenty, you must buy this album.  It's a great place to start.

Come on people!!!!  Mostly all of her songs have her voice distorted.  She doesn't even really sing in any of them.  I give the album 2 stars because there are a couple good songs.....but that's about it.  I think most of the people that buy her album are curious as to how it's going to sound.  I'm sad to say I actually paid money for it, because it was such a waste.  She needs to clean up her life and her image if she expects to get back into the pop scene.  I will say the girl can dance....but as far as the voice goes, she doesn't have it, and it shows in this particular album.

I've bought every Bruce album ever made, have been to more shows that I can count (including numerous times at Convention Hall in Asbury).  This album about what I was expecting and it falls well short of where he left off with the E-Street Band on The Rising.The good news: There isn't one bad song on the album.  This truely is in contrast to most of his albums where even the most ardent Bruce fan finds a tune or two truely hard to enjoy (at least at first).The downside: There really isn't a great song on the album.  Radio Nowhere is slightly catchy, seems a bit shallow and is as good as it gets on the album.As others have mentioned, the album's production is weak.  Bruce sounds muffled and overpowered by the music.Gone are the days of his first three albums where one tune could make you day dream for hours.  The Rising was the exception.  He needed such a catastrophic event (9/11) to come close to matching the writing inspiration of his youth.  He obviously struggled to write these songs as he's seemed to do with most of his tunes for the past 20 years.I still love his music, will continue to buy anything that he puts out.  This is worthy of buying, but it probably won't stand the test of time as one of his classic albums.

I love this band and yet they are so lazy. It's been five years and this is all we get? These new songs are decent at best. They should have put out a full LP with a few more songs. This band seems like they are finished. I love their last three records. But you would figure after waiting over five years the new songs would be a lot better. The songs aren't terrible but average at best. Now the greatest hits package has a nice choice in songs accept they could have included feel from their last album. Come on Matchbox Twenty, we deserve better.

Carrie has hit it out of the ball park with this, her second album. I was expecting a good collection of songs but this has exceeded all of my excpectations. From the emotional (Just A Dream & I Know You Won't) to the amazingly fun (Last Name & The More Boys I Meet) it is a well rounded and superbly written album. And to Carrie for nothing less than absolute flawless vocal performances on every song... A TRUE AMERICAN IDOL & COUNTRY ICON IN THE MAKING! It is a MUST if you are a Carrie fan and a fan of great music no matter the genre.

This is a real sonic step forward for Sam Beam and company, but not that much of a surprise for those who heard his excellent 2005 collaboration EP with Calexico, "In the Reins".  This is a much more rhythmically-appointed and stylistically varied collection of tunes than any previous I&W album, and it's a welcome change.  Sam Beam's trademark whispered vocals are still here, but he does actually get lively at times, especially on the uncharacteristic boogie-woogie of "The Devil Never Sleeps".  There's a certain organic "brightness" to this recording supported by rich instrumentation - an assortment of percussion, sitar, slide guitar, banjo, and so forth.  "Boy with a Coin" was the first "single" release of the album, and it's one of the very best tunes, with a driving rhythm line and a catchy chorus.  But every song here has its merits, from the strong opener, "Pagan Angel and a Borrowed Car" to the doo-wop ballad feel of the gorgeous closer, "Flightless Bird, American Mouth."  One could argue (and I will) that this is the best Iron and Wine CD to date, and with each listen it creeps closer to the top of my list of the best albums of 2007.

I heard so much raving about this new musical that I wanted to see it for myself.  Unfortunately, the show tickets were completely sold out the first few hours they were released when the show was coming to town for a few weeks.  That speaks volume about how great the show must be.  So I bought the CD, listened, and instantly loved it.  Eventually, I saw the live show too.  I have so much to write about this show, but I'll try to limit myself to give a review only about the CD.The CD features a good selection of songs from the play without giving away any surprises from the stage production (and there are many surprises!).  It leaves you wanting to see the live performance to see what you miss in the whole story.All the singers are excellent.  They do a very great job conveying the personalities, emotions, and energy of the characters.  "Defying Gravity" is one of my favorites as it very well conveys Elphaba's sense of freedom and independence to do what she believes in.  "No Good Deed" is another energetic and emotional song.  "For Good" is a very meaningful, emotional, and touching song about friendship and parting.

The soundtrack is without peer, in terms of recent Broadway musicals.  The craftsmanship of Steven Schwartz's score takes you through the highs and lows of the story.  The cast does a bang-up job, and you can actually follow the entire story of the play by simply listening to the soundtrack. I had read the book and a friend then sent me the CD before I saw Wicked on Broadway.  Before I had even seen the show, my family and I were driving around and belting out "Defying Gravity" and "One Short Day" at the top of our lungs.  It's a classic, buy it.

First, I have NOT seen the musical...boy, I wish I could but I love in a small, small town.  I just got the CD after recommendation from one of my daughter's friends.  We played the CD all the way home from vacation and then have since played it everytime we have gotten into the car.  Popular..Lar is my favorite because it's upbeat and funny.  I love all the others, except the spell casting song.  I really wish I could see the musical then maybe I could understand the songs better.  I love to sing with my daughters and this cd has produced hours of fun in just a few days!  Oh yeah, my husband even enjoyed it..and this is totally not his cup of tea!  He loved the percussion!

Carnival ride is awesome...I would say the songs are more reflective of the kind of songs/sound Carrie prefers.  Not to say that "Some Hearts" wasn't great, but this sound is more "her"...There's a mix of all types, something for everyone.  My favorites are "I Know You Won't", "Last Name", "All-American Girl" and "So Small".  Altho honestly I would recommend the entire CD.  Hopefully this CD will see just as well, if not better this time around!  Go Carrie!

I stumbled upon this album purely by accident and I couldn't believe I hadn't heard of this collaboration before it was released.There is NOTHING like this album out there.  I love Plant and Krauss for completely different reasons, but love them for the same on this album.  I haven't stopped listening to it since I first heard it. I love every song but my favorite has to be 'polly come home'.  The haunting melody will stay with you all day and that's okay because it's such a beautiful sound.  I'll be playing this album for everyone and anyone who comes into contact with me.  Bravo!!

I guess when you've been a bonified star for 35 years, you can do as you wish, but this is the last Bruce recording I'm buying site unseen...with production and recording standards like this, who needs enemies?The songwriting is marginal at best...compared to Richard Thompson, John Hiatt, Dave Alvin, et al, Bruce's skills have deteriorated - it's no wonder this CD is being sold used right here on Amazon at 66% off list a week after its release, it's drival.The only song that isn't significantly compressed and produced to death is the 12th cut which isn't even listed and I presume dedicated to his friend Terry Magovern-thankfully it was spared the producers and recording engineers hatchett.   Bruce or one of his handlers need to find SOMEBODY with a decent pair of ears...Rudy Van Gelder where are you when we need you most!!

Since many of the reviewers had seen the show before buying the soundtrack, I wanted to say that I really enjoy the soundtrack even though I haven't seen the show.  I first took it out of the library and found a number of the songs really catchy and I had to buy it.  The original cast, heard on the album, is incredibly talented.  My favorite songs are "Defying Gravity," "Dancing Through Life" and "Popular."  I hope to see the show, but the soundtrack is entertaining on its own merits.

There are so many people who have tried to surround Britney with negative energy and make her life more humiliating than she has done to herself and her behavior, but the thing is she is releasing the best album of her career today.  12 tracks, and 11 are very good, and one is just okay but is in a place to let you come down from the first half of the album.

It's Britney .....!!She's back and in a big way.  A whole lot more to this cd than most folks thought it would be (without hearing it).  I knew i was on to something when i first heard "Gimme More" and that's not even the best song on "Blackout".  The one that i'm really feeling in particular is "Piece of Me" where she's talking about being the target for the papparazzi and news media at every turn.  She asks if they really want a piece of her.They can't handle her or this cd as it brings something else for all the music lovers or ones that didnt know what Ms. B was capable of.  It's evident on the track "Get Naked (I Got a Plan) that she's got something "else" on her mind.  Along with "Freakshow" as well.  Also really enjoyed "Hot As Ice" and "Perfect Lover".Standout tracks on Blackout:  "Gimme More", "Piece of Me", "Radar", "Heaven on Earth", "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)", "Freakshow" and "Hot As Ice"Excellent cd from Britney and props to the producers and writers that helped her bring the heat back into the music scene and the energy into her music.

This album is definitely worth purchasing for the simple fact that it's Matchbox Twenty people! But okay, onto the music...the six new songs are great. A few are very catchy. All Your Reasons is definitely one to get hooked on. Also the first single How Far We've Come is very addictive as well as suprisingly uplifting. That track instantly puts me into a good mood. As for the eleven greatest hits...they rock! They have always rocked and will continue. Push never gets old and neither does Mad Season. Gotta love 'em! Now hopefully Matchbox Twenty puts out an album with all new tracks!! That would be awesome! Anywho...buy the cd...totally worth the money and the wait! :)

I love Matchbox Twenty, so I'm probably biased, but I think this is a great CD set.  There are two discs, one with six new songs, and a greatest hits disc.  I love the new single, "How Far We've Come," and the rest of the new songs are not bad either, although I think the single is the best of the bunch.  Of course, the greatest hits are wonderful songs, and it's great to have them all on one disc.  However, I wish that "Last Beautiful Girl" had been included.If you like Matchbox Twenty, or if you want to buy an overview of their music, this is the set for you.

Nice music, but nothing really deep neither on a vocal point of view nor on a musical one.For exemple, the Carrie Underwood version of the song Flat on the Floor is poor compared with Katrina Elam's one which is more powerful(nuances,her voice not forced but soulful,very good breaks with guitar solos).In fact, Carrie's version is good but straight, without any surprise.This second album is unfortunately under the first one.I'm waiting for the 3d one.

Yep, that's right. I'm not a fan of Britney for all the obvious reasons, like extremely poor judgment, stupidity, lack of actual talent, etc. But...I was in the mood for some pop fluff with good beats. This fits the bill. It's a very enjoyable CD. Yes, the vocals are very computerized-sounding, but I think it goes well with the music. It's part of the whole sound.  I really like Break the Ice, Gimme More, and Toy Soldier.  Now for some things I don't like. I can't stand when artists are constantly referring to themselves by name in songs. This makes sense in Piece of Me, but in many other tracks Britney is either referring to herself in the third person or having some male vocalist saying her name. I don't like it when regular people do this either. Makes them seem completely full of themselves in a desperate way. Britney seems pretty full of herself on this CD. It's all the same unoriginal theme. In almost every track, she does that creepy whisper moaning thing about how she wants to F someone, or how someone wants to F her, or how hot she thinks she is. On at least two tracks, she (or a male vocalist) refers to herself as legendary, LOL!  Can't she think of anything else to say at all? Now some rabid fans complain that others are judging her record based on her persona and not just the music, but when every song is about her persona, it's hard not to. But in the end, the lyrics don't matter much and neither does the vocalist herself.  The CD is fun, good for working out to, and perking yourself up during a boring commute. Overall, I would recommend it.

I adore this movie! It never gets old and every time I watch it I see something new that I didn't notice before. I got it for Christmas (1999)and didn't expect to like it all that much because my dad had said it had a  weak plot but when I did watch it I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe (the  only down side was then I missed some of the other hilarious jokes)Recently  while at a fellow beatles fan's house I made her watch Help and she loved  it so much that we watched it three times!The music is awesome and is the  kind that gets super-glued in your head . Thanks to me my neighborhood  loves the Beatles! Ringo is FABULOUS!

The human interest story behind the music is what made it intriguing to my family in the first place, but the CD itself is holding their fascination.  I collect a fair amount of music, and lately this is the CD that my wife, my daughters (13 and 14) and my son (16) play again and again.  Of greater importance, this has led my son to obtain a 3 CD set of Pavarotti, whose songs now share space on his iPod with Led Zeppelin and Incubus (sp?).  Some folks object to his lack of polish or some technical quibbles, but I would ask: When watching the Olympics of years gone by, who was more inspiring? The Soviet trained athletes, sent away from families to learn the technical skills to win medals for their country; or the upstart young kid full of heart and God-given skill?  I hope my analogy speaks for itself.  Buy the CD of the upstart young man.  Your heart will be made glad.

okay, I am a huge music fan over all.  I do give everything at least one chance not being too over critical.  Now you can see what the press is doing to Britney. What the heck happened to this album. It was kind of a letdown. Yes I hear what people say about albums and stuff, yet I still give it a fair chance in case I liked it then I can definitely agree or disagree with them. Here is my take on this album.Good title for the album though.  I don't think there is a worse album out there. Makes Hanson sound 100 times better. Other then a few tracks (heaven on earth & Radar) this album should stay on the shelf. LIGHTS OUT ON THIS DISASTER.

Britney is someone whose career has been largely based on image.  Don't pretend when you think of hit me baby, you aren't thinking of her in the catholic school girl outfit, or Me against the music thinking of the Madonna kiss.  This of course becomes problimatic when your image is divorce, losing your children, drug addiction, car crashing (do I need to continue?).  As such, most will listen to this album and love it, given that it is not reflective of her sporadic life, but instead a fairly coherent album.  This is unfortunate in that the album will get far better reviews than it deserves, in fact some will state this shows her true side and is a comeback.  Neither are true, as she didn't write most of this album, but hired top producers to do it for her, and since she really hasn't fallen in sales or disappeared, its not a come back.  This album, much like In the Zone, is nothing more than a few great singles, and some listenable music.  If you like Britney you'll be happy.  If not, nothing will convert you.  But before you buy it, realize there will be no revelations into her current media issues, or anything close to acknowledging them, just some catchy club beats, some swearing, and a few catchy tunes.

Saying you hate this musical is like saying you eat babies for breakfast. But I saw it this weekend, and hated it, and so did 5 of my friends. Pass the babies.Every song--EVERY song--sounds the freakin' same. The Wizard's number starts out as a softshoe, but then changes its mind and goes back to schmaltzy pop. Glinda's "Popular" also starts well, but then falls apart (and several published reviews will confirm this). The rest of the soundtrack is the same old jumble of cookie-cutter musical theatre that we all know so well, with little variation between styles. They had so much leeway here--they're not bound by any specific time period or theme--so why make everything come out sounding like a Jazzercise class?Quite aside from the music, the lyrics often don't make sense. Several of the characters are radically different from the versions we are familiar with (the Tin Man is capable of hate? What?). The songs do absolutely nothing to advance the plot (which moves at a snail's pace), or to develop characters. They're just tedious time-outs on a very long yellow brick road, and will have you checking your program compulsively to see how much more of this you have to sit through. If you thought Phantom was genius, well....this is the musical for you. But if you like genuine writing talent and creativity, look elsewhere.

Wicked is a marvelous show that, at first, I thought was overrated.  So many people talk about how great it is, and I was certain that it had to be mostly hype.  Then, I got the soundtrack and I'm now the one cheering it on.  It's a creative show, based on a wonderful book, with fantastic vocals and refreshingly new music.  I thoroughly enjoyed this show, though there were a few songs that I felt were dull and dragged a bit.  For the most part, though, I loved it and think that it's a great way to interest another generation in the joys of Broadway.

I honestly am dumbfounded so many people think this can be a 4 or 5 star album.  Have people listened to it?  Have they heard Britney can't hold a note, her voice is raspy or that you can barely understand what she is saying?  Sure there are some good beats behind the music but that has nothing to do with her.  Her singing is horrible. I would have to think 90% of these reviews are from kids under the age of 16 that don't appreciate good singing anyway.  Please go onto MSN and listen to the whole album and then decide.

Annie Lennox doesn't do light and fluffy. You either welcome the austerity of that three-octave voice - or run for the hills.When last we heard from her, in 2003 when she released the album "Bare", she was recovering from her second divorce.Beneath the seductively melodic surface, the rawness of her emotional state was documented in a desolate and often self-lacerating style.Four years later, she is back with "Songs of Mass Destruction", a title hardly suggestive of joie de vivre.Her fourth solo album is  a wonderful brooding affair.The new single "Dark Road" is ostensibly about a failed love affair - but also refers to our love-hate relationship with America; the gospel-tinged "Ghosts", a bruised lament.But it's not all woe. Check out the dissonant "Womankind" ('Wish I had a lover who could turn this squalor into wine'), while the show stopper is "Sing" - a collaboration with 23 female superstars, including Madonna, Joss Stone, Dido, Shakira, Pink and..lo and behold! even Celine Dion, contributed - that is incandescent.It is a feminist anthem inspired by Aids activists in South Africa, with all profits going to TAC (Treatment Action Campaign). Annie Lennox's personal emotional territory is universal emotional territory.There's nowhere else to be when that voice is singing."Songs of Mass Destruction" is a powerful piece of work, and it showcases a voice that has developed a depth and power that are unmatched in today's pop landscape.The album turns out to be a fairly appropriate title for this collection of tunes. Like little cluster bombs, each of these tracks comes power-packed with a devastating emotional charge, with Lennox's crystal-clear vocals merely adding to the impact.This is raw, beautiful and brutal stuff, wrapped up in soaring melodies and sweet harmony.

I've been to many different types of musicals and this is by far one of the best newer ones out there.  You can sing along with the songs, and feel both uplifted and saddened at the lyrics.  Very good twists to the meanings in the songs.  Funny and captivating in its circular storyline.

I purchased this CD through ITunes.  Fogerty's voice is still pretty good, despite the advancing years.  However, none of the songs are really memorable in their own right like his past classics, with the possible exception of Creedence Song and Gunslinger.  Worth a listen, perhaps, but not a buy.

All Grobanites know what this young man does with a piece of music, so raving about his singing is a waste of time.  The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the choice of songs. However, the more I listen to it, the more I love it, so I'm hoping he's saved my favorites for next year's CD.  Should you buy it?  Why wouldn't you?  It's Josh!

Carrie Underwood is a force to be reckoned with! This album firmly places her at the top of the American Idol heap. After so many seasons of the show its not going to guarantee a succesful career just by being crowned the winner. You absolutely have to stand out from the crowd. Carrie Underwood is by far the most succesful winner (Daughtry didn't even come in 3rd remember, but his band has been wildly succesful regardless.) On "Carnival Ride" there are some WONDERFUL tracks my personal favorite is "Told you so" simply becuase my mom used to play the Randy Travis version all the time so its a sentimental thing for me. Anyway, get this cd it rocks hard and should win a grammy for album of the year but we know how prejudiced the grammys are against country music. Other rockin' cds to buy this year? Rascal Flatts' "Still feels good" is so fun you can't help but turn up the volume and sing along also Josh Groban's christmas cd "Noel" is phenomonal and will become an iconic christmas album for years to come.

ElectroSynthPop lives again: enough producers to guarantee the best work imaginable, GIMME MORE is just the tip of a great, mindless album that is repeat-playable and pounds a great beat. Unexpected... especially as the content isn't what I'd expect to hear around an office, but it is as close as a masterpiece of production as you can get. The best reason to go back to a record store in 2007...

Never before has music touched my heart in such a powerful way. When I first saw Wicked, I was absolutely blown away by the wit, wisdom, and magic that the show had. This is a true American masterpiece and I thank Stephen Schwartz for bringing this phenomenal music into the world. All of the songs are amazing, all of them. Idina Menzel's voice is empowering and magnificent, Kristen Chenoweth's soprano is whimsical and in Popular, she is bubbly and fun and fantasitic. The Wizard brings in his share of tunes, Sentimental Man and Wonderful, both stunning. Fiyero's voice is tender and strong and his Dancing Through Life is just plain old fun, along with One Short Day and What Is This Feeling. And the orchestral sections in No One Mourns The Wicked and Dacing are spectacular. And when finishing with For Good and Finale, nothing is more beautiful than Elphaba and Glinda singing their goodbyes together that will jerk tears and give you goosebumps. Buy this CD and see the play and be enlightened.

Here's how I listen to a new album by Bruce Springsteen: with earphones, first time straight through, simply trying to get the lay of the land, picking up echoes of past tracks, the distinctive build of a Springsteen song - from lean to thicker, more layered sounds, Steven comes in, two-part harmony, then the full choir of harmonic voices and instrumentation, the glockenspiels, maracas, a Farfisa, bells, the works, major-chord progressions. Which voice? Raw Jersey bar blues belter? Woody/Country? Dylanesque? Shout-rock? Picking up some new touches, anomalous twists - hey, that sounds like the vamp from "Paranoid Android," and in the same key! - and so on. Three-quarters of the tracks strike me as each reminiscent of five other tracks from earlier albums. A first overall impression: "It seems melodically tired."But this is how it always begins. (OK, not always: not The Rising. The 9/11 connections were too vivid, too moving.)Then I listen again. The hooks really hook. The songs rock, kick ass. The ballads are affecting, poignant. The title track is haunting; the production sparkles. But mostly, it's the Band playing tutti, in full din. The wall of sound punches holes in my chest. Something begins to move around, swell inside my gut. There's inevitably a track I can't get out of my head - the refrain stays with me the entire next day, "The girls in their summer clothes...pass me by..." I try, but I can't chase it away. Once it gets going, it's hard to concentrate on my work. I slip the pod out and try it in the dock as background music. Mistake: more than distracting. It takes over. The huge recorded sound sounds remarkably like the huge concert sound. And I'm locked in...only picking up snatches of lyrics except for the bell-clear title track and the hidden one, "Terry's Song." But it's the sound, passing through me and continuing to reverberate in the dead space between tracks, until the next song begins. That sound, mostly thick major chord progressions, open strings, key of D or capo'd for open strings, familiar, yet new. It's that Brendan O'Brien again. How does it stack up against the others? It doesn't matter. It's brilliant.OK. I'm in the tank for Bruce. Same age. Jersey. Asbury. Boardwalk. Convention Hall. Certainly at the same concerts in '66, '67 - Doors, Airplane, Mitch Ryder, The Who. I've been down a lot of those backstreets, broke free in a '57 Chevy, all that. Still, I don't want to give him a pass. But by the third play, the music has taken over, and now I'm not going to listen to anything else for a while, except perhaps to go back to the beginning, to Greetings, and work my way all the way through everything. Again.We try to resist, try to push this experience into the cognitive side of the brain, rationalize it, pick the tracks apart. It's no good. HE's too good. He goes straight for the affective hemisphere, to the emotional center. Listen to what he says about writing this stuff. He knows exactly what he's doing, knows exactly how it's going to hit us, both on record and in the arena and the stadium. (No one - NO one - can be that intimate with 90,000 stomping baby boomers. And he's got the best sound men in the business.) I don't want to be manipulated that easily. But I suppose I do.So, yeah, Magic is brilliant, maybe the best since The River. But again, what does it matter how it stacks up? Anything that gives this much pleasure doesn't need to be compared to anything else.Others have talked - Bruce himself has talked- about the anger, the disappointment, the rage that underlies some of these songs. (See A.O. Scott's very nice piece in the 30 September NY Times.) Lots of familiar influences - Dylan, Van Morrison, Spector. And there are indeed some new influences - or at least new echoes, of Stephin Merritt/Magnetic Fields ("Girls" might almost one of the 69 Love Songs, although it's legit to ask "who's influencing whom?") and, briefly, Radiohead in "Magic." (Radiohead's downloadable In Rainbow is splendid! But for a very different taste.) The band remains in superb form. There's a lot of the Big Man throughout. It's another very Catholic record (as is the album iconography). And all those surf guitars, Spectoresque walls of sound, Max pumping away like mad (you can see him, can't you? No drummer has posture that ramrod straight. Max's "signature posture"?).But it's the sheer shimmering, buzzing, thumping, soaring, anthemic pop rock sound of it all that lingers and lingers and lingers...

I know this won't be a popular review, but I find this album largely disappointing.  Annie Lennox has been the voice behind a lot of great pop music over the last 30 years, so she has a big reputation to live up to--both as the voice of Eurythmics and solo.  "Diva" and "Bare" are both superior albums to this one.  There are some highlights here--"Dark Road," "Sing," "Love is Blind," "Coloured Bedspread."  She is strongest on the uptempo tracks.  It isn't that I don't like ballads--"Bare" was full of beautiful ones, but it is on slower numbers that her voice is showing it's age.  She simply has trouble holding her pitch in softer voice--"Fingernail Moon" is a case in point.  Some will think that adds character to the music--I do not.Annie Lennox's commitment to activism is admirable--pop musicians speaking out does make a difference.  I just wish she would take a more activist stance in her lyrics.  She falls back mostly on old familiar themes of the devastation of love and personal grief--which she used to marvelous effect on "Bare."  I would just like to have heard more of a new direction from her.On the whole, enjoyable, but we all know that she is capable of more.

I love this band, but.... greatest hits after nothing for 5 years? Bad move guys.. get back in the studio and show your fans your talent. In a perfect world Rob Thomas would be able to juggle a solo career with the band also. On a good note: anyone who is a new listener to this band please buy this CD. You will love every song on it. They have an awesome sound and once a fan, your a fan for life. Listen to the snipits of each track and then you can really judge for yourself.

I was not the biggest fan of In Your Honor, so when this hit the shelves, I was hoping it would not be in the vein of that album.  It sure isn't.  This is a nice blend of the sound like One By One and There Is Nothing Left To Loose.  Heavy and fast with a few slowed down songs.  Sure, they released the first track "The Pretender" as the first single, usually a sign of failure of an album.  That track is strong, but so is the rest of the album.  Let it die, erase/replace, and the ballad of beaconsfield miners are all great tracks.  Well mixed, and sorted in order.  A must have for any FOO FAN, or good intro to what the Foo fighters have been doing for over 10 years now.  buy this album

I was a bit apprehensive in purchasing the entire cd subject to the 'fooies' reviews. Why compare it to past ventures? Compare it to what is out there and available in todays market. I love this cd and have had it on rotation for several weeks now with no sight of boredom. It starts with 'The Pretender', definitely foo fighter typical. The remainder of the cuts take you on a journey that maybe you didn't expect. It ends with 'Home' which is destined to be a classic in a 'Neil Young' kind of way. The cd rocks and then it makes you all warm and fuzzy. Nice balance.

Her personal life may be in the toilet, but despite all of that Britney Spears has managed to record her best album YET!  The worst thing about this album is the cover.  Thanks Jive!  You guys took one of the most beautiful stars in the world and successfully made the ugliest CD cover in all of music history.  BUT, don't judge a book by its cover or in this case a CD by its cover!  The quality of music on this cd is AMAZING and some of Britney's best yet!  Every song is great.  They will get you moving and singing along as a good album should.  Blackout is the album everybody should own!  You won't be disappointed.  Viva la Britney!

First of all, this is no "Some Hearts". A bit of the innocence and freshness is lost, and yes its very, very clear that Carrie ain't in Checotah anymore. Is this a good thing? Well, its a mixed bag.Second, be prepared for all sorts of debates on country music television as to whether this album is country or not. I doubt that purists from Nashville will buy this as a country album. There are very marked country elements, but its still a very pop-country album. Not as pop as Shania Twain or Faith Hill, but it does veer a little into that territory every now and then. Now this is not necessarily a bad thing, and hey it worked for me, but Carrie could end up facing more criticism for this album as it would be very, very easy for people to classify this as a pop album.The major issue is with the first single : "So Small". I like that all of Carrie's first singles from an album have got to do with God (remember "Jesus take the Wheel" from the first CD?), but "So Small" is not even one-tenth the wonder that was "Jesus take the wheel". In fact, its a very weak tune, and the cringe-worthy lyrics do nothing to elevate it beyond the average mess that it is. The bigger problem is the tune. It is instantly forgettable and I doubt we would be humming this a year down the line a la some of the tunes from "Some Hearts".Do I think "Some Hearts" is the superior album? Yes and No. Yes, it did have far more accessible tunes and sounded more authentically country than this does. But no, in terms of artistic growth and spreading ones' wings, this album is definitely better than her debut CD. The closest comparison I can make (barring the genre of course) is the difference between Kelly Clarksons' "Breakaway" CD and her recent "My December" CD. The same can be said of "Carnival Ride".However, when this album wants to be country, it can really be country. The opening track is my current favorite. Immediately better than anything on "Some Hearts" (except maybe for "We're Young and Beautiful") its a whiskey-soaked jam that will have you hitting repeat. Infectious. I could listen to this song on repeat for hours and never get bored. Its a better opener to the album than "Wasted" was on "Some Hearts". "You Won't Find This" and "All American Girl" are the two other standouts. The former, especially, with its singalong chorus, should appeal to country radio almost immediately (it sounds like Shania's tunes in her heyday, actually). I only wish they had put her wonderful AI song "I'll Stand by You" here as that was a very memorable track from Underwood.I've been playing this (along with the latest Yoko Ono record, ironically) on my Ipod for the last two days, and yes, it does get better with repeated listenings. I cannot wait for the day when "Flat on the Floor" is officially released as a single because obviously that is the standout track of the album - with its fiddles, guitars and vocal harmonizing meeting beautifully. Its' one of Carrie's greatest achievements on record, and you should get this if only just to hear that.Heres the thing - Carrie is no Reba McEntire or Dolly Parton. In fact the strength of those two performers were their deep twangs and their gift of story telling through every single song. Here, Carrie has opted for a more pop sensibility, which I don't consider *true* country. Still, its a halfway country album and I can appreciate it for what it is. I only wish she would use her twang and Checotah verbal stylings more on her recordings and not sound so much like a squeaky clean L.A. Moppet on some songs (its evident, really, on some tracks). Other than this, its a wonderful second album.Four Stars. I'm not yet sure this will have the staying power of "Some Hearts", but its jam-packed with monster tunes that you will be humming for days to come, so on that count, its a winner already. Just get past the weak first single "So Small" and there are some amazing tracks here to enjoy.

First of all, I did not go into listening to this CD hoping to hear a carbon copy of Creedence.  Fortunately, what I heard was a singer/songwriter who has gone back to what he does best: writing great rock and roll with catchy melodies and great guitar work.  Sure, there are some definite tips of the hat to Creedence with tunes like "Creedence Song" and "Long Dark Night", but Fogerty also gives us his country side with "Gunslinger" and a tribute to his rockabilly heroes with "It Ain't Right".  I love the nod he gives Bo Diddley with the song, "Natural Thing".  Upon hearing "Broken Down Cowboy", there is no doubt that Mr. Fogerty has done some serious soul searching over the years.  In my opinion, John Fogerty is one of the top American songwriters in the history of American music.  Lyrically, he reminds me of Chuck Berry who always told stories with his songs.  Fogerty's criticims of the Bush administration are right on, and they are short, sweet and to the point.  They say life is a journey and if anyone had told me 38 years ago when I bought my first Creedence record, that at age 48 I'd still be listening to John Fogerty with the same enthusiasm and joy, I'd have said they were nuts.  But fortunately for all of us, John Fogerty has continued on his musical journey (although there were a couple of detours along the way).  It seems that John Fogerty has found his musical center and is truly happy.  Hopefully for us fans this means a few more new batches of music before he hangs up his guitar strings for good.

I've been waiting for this CD ever since someone emailed me Paul Potts' audition on YouTube. I don't care if purists say his voice isn't perfect, we all KNOW the guy was working in a warehouse last month. Give him a chance to get some more training. He moves us all to tears, though, and that cannot be taught.

I have listened to this album about 5 or 6 times and really like it. Fogerty has bounced back after releasing the sub par Deja Vu which sold only 200,000 copies and found Fogerty trying break new ground with mixed results. It wasn't John. Now he has returned and has made a very strong album. Here is my breakdown of the songs:1) Don't You Wish it Was True - 9/10 - It took awhile for this song to grow on me, but it has. It has that old CCR feel to it and is a very positive and uplifting song. Yes most wish it was true than the reality of the way the world really is. 2) Gunslinger - 10/10 - Best solo song I have heard from John. Too many try to interpret its meaning. I prefer to take it as it is, a song about an old western town over run with villians and needing a hero. 3) Creedence Song - 8/10 - Not as good as I hoped. Would have been better if John made it more autobiographical than a made up story which is rather weak. Good, not great.4) Broken Down Cowboy - 9/10 - this song is autobiographical about the state he was in when he met Julie. It speaks with brutal honesty. Great song.5) River is waiting - 9/10 - a song that deal with letting go of pain. It is very moving and another uplifting song.6) Long Dark Night - 9/10 - I think this is a great political satire and features a voice that sounds like the old Fogerty from CCR - raw & powerful. It also has blues harp on it that we haven't heard since 1975.7) Summer of Love - 8/10 - Yes it is dated, but a decent song about a time in the past. Much better than In the Garden.8) Natural Thing - 6/10 - the only dud on the cd. It is too repetitive musically and lyrically and drags on too long. 9) It Ain't Right - 7.5/10 - a pretty good tune about the Paris Hiltons of the world who are spoiled and waste their lives away. Maybe a bit too short.10) I Can't Take it No More - 8/10 I like it because it reminds me of Travelin Band and it rocks quite well. Fogerty is letting off steam like Lennon let off steam in How Do You Sleep. I like both and feel people take these songs too personally. 11) Somebody Help Me - 6.5/10 - This song is ok, but again it is made up and just doesn't move me in any way.12) Longshot - 8/10 - This is a good song, but not great. It is more like a song the Rolling Stones, AC/DC or Foreigner might do. It ends the album on a high note.

Why is Carnival Ride Just a Dream?  Because it's unbelievably good and the best song on the album is also called Just a Dream.Underwood shows in this album how much she has grown as an artist and how wonderful her voice is.  Let's talk about vocals!  Her range, pitch, tone and absolutely everything about her voice is heaven sent.This sophomore effort shows how she has also grown as a song writer.  4 of the most powerful tracks were written by her and let me you that if she's not talented enough now she also jumps big time into writing flawlessly.This Carnival Ride is certainly just starting.  This album promises a lot.  Instant hits are just waiting to be released to radio and tv.Congratulations Carrie!  Thanks for letting us be part of your Carnival Ride.

If you like disco/techno rock you may may have some interest in this product. It is slick,well produced stuff but nothing you haven't heard many times before, with more interesting and memorable music.This music was interesting in the '80s. Now it's pretty much old hat.If you're nostalgic or a die hard Britney fan this will satisfy you. Otherwise, save your money.

Would you actually buy this album if it was not put out by Springsteen? The only song of note is "Radio Nowhere". The rest is all pretty unremarkable.  The man should ditch O'Brein as a producer.  The muddy  production is terrible.  It sounds a lot like "The Rising" only with weaker songs.  And Springsteen's great voice, where did it go?  He traded in the majesty of his viseral howl (ala the "Born To Run" and "Darkness" albums) for some contrived twang.  Incidently I wrote a song called "FM Prayer" about 15 years ago, it is about isolation and the dichotomy of the power of radio and in the chorus I ask "Is there anybody out there?"  But then I always have been a bit ahead of my time...:)

Never mind the negative comments from those who know not the history of popular music in the USA...Listening to Alison and Robert, it's almost like a history lesson...The Blues...The Folk and the Country side of American Popular Music.  Two generations of popular music..the roots of Americana and the magic of current generations all come together in "Raising Sand". If you're looking for Led Zeppelin Robert Plant, you're surely to be very disappointed...but just listen closely..you'll hear echos of early Led Zeppelin influences. The more acoustic influences...  For all of those youngsters and left behind Baby Boomers...listen and learn the history you've missed out on...and enjoy the roots of true American Music, at it's finest. This recording is a "CLASSIC"

After listening to this CD for 3 straight days now, I wanted to like this CD.... but the Boss is the boss no more.I used to buy his stuff unseen for 20+ years, because like Dylan he was a poet, a master of the craft of songwriting.  Singer and player, he never was much of one, but he was all about the song and the vibe.  I used to tell aspiring songwriters to buy his CD's even if they did not like him just to see how he crafted words into aural paintings and sonic flowers.Yes, like a lot of people here, I complain of the horrible mastering of this CD (apparently it was mixed for IPOD, where are the dynamics?), Max's drums sound dulland buried, Little Steven's guitar work is obscured by countless other tracks competing for the same frequency range.After taking this CD to my Sydec/SSL Soundscape and I quickly see virtually no waveforms on all the louder songs.  Confirmed, NO DYNAMICS! It seems Brenden's affection for the limiter/compression plugins on Pro Tools were designed for 2 dollar IPOD headphones.  But I will get by Brenden's complete massacre of the sound.  Can you tell I am not a fan of his, after all look at his work, he has ruined every band he has done.   I fail to hear the room at Southern Tracks in the mixes.Where in the hades is Clarence?????  As I search my memory of the songs, I can think of two moments where I even HEARD him.  Sad to think that THE MAGIC of the Sax, Clarence's sax, is not even burned into my memory.  To compare this record as the best since "...USA" is make one's musical tastes get thrown up with last nights Varsity's chili dogs (sorry Atlanta).THE BOSS has ripped off himself and others on this CD.  Yes there are some clever lines that do exist, But muscially there is NOTHING new here.  NOTHING!!!!!  Nothing to make me think, "WOW he did it!  He pulled one from out of nowhere and made the music world fresh, new, exciting, cool."  Nope, I when I hear "Gypsy" at low level, I hear U2's "God's Country",  "Magic" is a blantant rip off of a Eric Clapton, who's ripped of the JJ Cale (at least Eric gives him JJ credit for his songs and style influence).  I have heard so many JJ Cale's songs that shred this song to bytes on my IPOD. On "Livin in the future", he just rips his own song off that he did on "...USA" and "The Rising".  And it justs goes on... and on.  Nothin new under the Bruce sun.The hidden track is the best song, because it was raw and emotional...human.I will not even get into the political overtones he has sunk into.  Hey Bruce, get back to life and love and stay off politics.  (I am just wonderin when are these artist/hollywood types going to realize that the socialized world/Bush hating disease of Hillary Clinton is going to turn the US into another Soviet Union, where there was NO artistic freedom.  Careful of what you wish for....Yes, sure Russia was a world leader of the arts for centuries, but once Lenin came along it ALL died and still is.  But that is another review altogether.Overall, this album fails to compare to "Tunnel of Love" and "Human Touch" and to compare it Born in the USA is nothing short of total unpatriotic BRUCE.  I miss the BOSS, I miss "Born in the USA", "Born to Run", "57 channels"  (come on now who can not admit when they heard this song they thought 'WAY, WAY COOL.  WAY!!!!'), "Walk like a Man", "Nebraska", "Used Cars".  I am just wondering what is Clemons going to do on this tour?  Nils where are you?   Max please take out the picolo snare so I can hear some dynamics!!!  Brenden lose the compressor plugin!   Gosh, I hope Toby Scott is going to mix the live show, if not, I am not buying tickets!!!

I agree that "O Holy Night" should have been included. Even so, there are two extremely awesome songs on this album. The duet with Brian McKnight is the most unbelievable version of "Angels We Have Heard on High" that I've ever heard. And "Thankful" is so absolutely beautiful, both musically and lyrically.These are my two favorites, and I play them over and over again.Thank you, Josh!

Due to storage issues, I am coming to re-evaluate my need to buy CDs.  iTunes and others offer attractive prices on single songs, liner notes and lyrics are often available on the artist sites, and let's face it--there are very few CDs that I like every song."Magic" is one of that category.  People liken it to "Born in the USA," "The Rising", all the good Springsteen and I'd agree--because the spirit of the collection is on that level--there's just no filler here.  Of course, the Boss has things to say about American life, culture, etc.  "Radio Nowhere" the song I first heard from this collection talks about the state of the broadcast industry:I was tryin' to find my way homeBut all I heard was a droneBouncing off a satelliteCrushin' the last lone American nightThis is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?And he's right--you wonder that when you're searching the FM band for something that's not "Jack", "Earl", or "Bob." (Didn't that used to be Tom, Dick and Harry?)Probably the hardest song to listen to is "Living in the Future."  One verse literally gave me chills:Woke up Election Day, skies gunpowder and shades of grayBeneath a dirty sun, I whistled my time awayThen just about sundownYou come walkin' through townYour boot heels clickin'Like the barrel of a pistol spinnin' 'roundJust when you think the future's a bleak and terrible place, "Girls in their Summer Clothes" leaves you with a little more hope.  A kids rubber ball smacksOff the gutter 'neath the lamp lightBig bank clock chimesOff go the sleepy front porch lightsDowntown the stores alight as the evening's underwayThings been a little tightBut I know their gonna turn my wayThis particular song took me back to my childhood in a time when people used less air conditioning and spent their time outdoors actually hearing the chimes and seeing what was going on in the street. The magic of this particular CD is that it does take you places.  Some of them are not comfortable--most of them make you think, but that's what Bruce and the E Street Band is all about--good music with a message to go along with it.

This CD is Kid Rock at his best. I loved this album from start to finish. Blue Jeans and a Rosary is one of the best songs on the album. I want to be clear, however, EVERY song is great! Buy it!!!

I've been listening to this CD, I'd like to say non-stop, but I do have to work for a living. There's just so much variety and nuance. I think it's very powerful work for the band.There's classic 'FF' stuff, as well, but as a whole it's a great surprise to this long-time fan. Buy it, give it a listen. You'll love it like I do, hopefully.

Fantastic CD.  Kid Rock wins again with a great album that pays tribute to real early 70s rock (i.e. Bob Seger).  Roll On and Amen are the stand out songs to me at least.  If you're a fan of great, traditional rock and roll then this album is for you.

I got the CD and I think her songs are great.  She definitely does not have any sappy songs on this album.  It's definitely a dance album. It doesn't matter what she does, in the end her music rocks.  She has this unique voice that people can't really imitate. Overall, I think this is one of the best albums she has.

NOT OVERLY IMPRESSED WITH THIS CD. MUSIC IS VERY COMMON AND IS COPIED FROM ANDREA BOCELLI MUSIC..SAME SONGS BUT SUNG IN ITALIAN TO GIVE IT SOME SPIFF. SEEMS THAT ORCHESTRA WAS OVERPOWERING PAUL NOTTS. I HAVE PLAYED IT THREE TIMES AND DETERMINDED IT IS NOT TO MY LIKING.

This is undeniably the best album ever to come from the mind of Kid Rock.  I didn't think I could love the man's music any more than I already did until I heard the songs.  All Summer Long is a nostalgic piece, taking me back to my youth.  Blue Jeans & a Rosary speaks volumes of young love, undying faith in each other and the positive power believing in someone can have.  This is definitely worthy of anyone's permanent collection.

I had never seen a performance and had only heard a couple of the songs from Wicked before I bought this CD.  After listening to the whole thing several times during a drive across the state, I'm anxious to be in the audience of a performance!  The music and singers are great, and the story comes through even if you don't know that much about it. If you love musicals, this one is a must have!

It's not There Is Nothing Left to Lose, but it's still great - probably better than [[ASIN: 1193944144 In Your Honour]].  BTW this 'product link' thing needs work.  HTML tag support wouldn't hurt either.

An excellent DVD of HELP! Lots of additional material and a cleaned up picture and soundtrack. The songs sound especially clear and crisp. It's a fun movie that even non-Beatles fans will enjoy. My only complaint is the english subtitles. The english subtitles don't always match what is being said in the film. It seems somebody decided it would be a good idea to do a British english to American english translation of the dialog. It should have been done word-for-word because a lot of the humor and charm is lost in the process. Other than that small annoyance, it's excellent

...in delight.Let me start by saying that when my sister and mom came home raving about this play, the first thing that popped into my head was "overrated" and I thought they were going on and on just because they'd only seen it for the first time. So, I had no particular desire to see it.I walked into my sister's room and she was playing "Popular." At first listen, it was a nice little ditty, but she'd play it over and over, and I found myself wandering into her room more often. I fell in love with the song.On Tuesday, I went to the play in Chicago with my family, and words can't even describe how much I love this show. The characters were terribly affecting, and, if it's possible, a few of the songs were even more so.I realize the show is more of a Disney version of the book than it is accurate, but it doesn't bother me at all. It still conveys the emotion (more so than does the book, I think), and it is still very, very poignant. I deeply regret the fact that I don't live in New York, and as a result I didn't have a chance to see the original cast, but I love the show all the same. Almost every song is irreplaceable."No One Mourns the Wicked" - 8/10. This is a great show-opener, and I love the opening chords both played and sung. It does get a bit mushy with Kristin Chenoweth's opera (though by no means am I putting her voice down), but otherwise provides an excellent introduction to the story."Dear Old Shiz" - 6/10. On the CD, it pretty much does nothing for me. However, I love the harmonies and the emphasized "zzzz" at the end, and being that it's so short, I see no reason to skip it."The Wizard and I" - 10/10. Idina Menzel shines on this song. Every time I listen to this song, I feel a pang of sadness when she starts to sing about the "celebration throughout Oz, that's all to do with me." She's so optimistic in this song, and I can't help but be touched by it."What Is This Feeling?" - 9/10. The only reason I'm not giving this a 10 is because this is a song that's a lot better live. It needs the physical interaction. Menzel and Chenoweth are both hysterical on this song, but this version (for me), leaves something to be desired. When I saw the show in Chicago, Kristy Cates (Elphaba) did a sort of a little Glinda-esque jig to mock her. That alone made me love the song."Something Bad" - 7/10. I like this song because it's important to the plot. But otherwise, it's not exceptional."Dancing Through Life" - 8/10. This song needs to be live to be appreciated. After just one listen, I wasn't impressed with Norbert Leo Butz's voice, but it grew on me. And I absolutely LOVE the little song with Boq and Nessarose. It's the reason I listen to the song."Popular" - 10/10. This was the first song I ever heard off the CD, so I can't help but love it. It's witty, it's funny, and at times, it's touching (when Elphaba says "I have to go")."I'm Not That Girl" - 9/10. If you're a teenage girl, be prepared to love this song. Be prepared to identify with it. Idina Menzel shows her versatility by singing this song, for it is the one song on the CD where she doesn't have an especially high or belt-worthy note. But it's touching and there are a couple of lines that I love. ("She who's winsome, she wins him" for one.)"One Short Day" - 9/10. This is another song that benefits from a live performance. With that said, it's still fun to listen to on the CD."A Sentimental Man" - 9/10. I like this song. It's nothing extraordinary, but I like it all the same."Defying Gravity" - A million/10. This is, by far, the best song on the CD. Idina Menzel steals the show with this show-stopper. I get chills when I listen to this song, and even more of them when I think of the message behind this song. If you're looking for a really good "screw you" song, this is it. And it has amazing vocals to boot."Thank Goodness" - 9/10. This is a good Act II opener. It's funny, it's bittersweet, and it's fun to listen to. My only qualm is that there are some cheesy lines in here. Particularly when Kristin Chenoweth sings "There are bridges you crossed you didn't know you crossed until you crossed." That's too many uses of the word "crossed" in one sentence for me."Wonderful" - 9/10. I like this song for the lyrics and Joel Grey's voice. I wish he had more songs on the CD, but hey, beggars can't be choosers."I'm Not That Girl (Reprise)" - 7/10. It's a good song in that it gives you a feeling for the true depth of Glinda's emotions. It's not even a minute, so it's not really that much of a song anyway, but it's a nice lead-in to "As Long As You're Mine.""As Long As You're Mine" - 10/10. This is a song that grew on me. At first, it was a bit too poppy for me, but it has emotion. I like Norbert Leo Butz's voice a lot better in this song than in "Dancing" and I think he sounds great with Idina Menzel."No Good Deed" - 10/10. This is probably one of the most heart-wrenching songs on the whole CD. We all feel for Elphaba when she finally decides to become wicked, and my heart breaks every time she screams Fiyero's name. There is so much raw emotion in this song that it's hard not to love it."March of the Witch Hunters" - 7/10. It's an okay song. Not one of the better ones, but it makes you root for Elphaba even more."For Good" - 20/10. This is my favorite song. It makes me cry every time I hear it. The emotion in this song is so believable and real. The friendship between Glinda and Elphaba is so touching, and it's so sad to know that it's finally at end. This is more of a climax to the show than the finale is."Finale" - 6/10. Good ending. `Nuff said.I'm in love with this entire CD. It's not at all a waste of money to go and buy it.

The singing scenes of this movie are worth remembering and each time you see them, these guys glisten. Theres George Harrison singing "I Need You" very well. This is definitely a very unserious movie but much of it a classic to keep. "Another Girl" belongs to Paul McCartney, he sings it way cool and draws the line. Ringo is royal to the beat. John Lennon is naughty and inquisitive. These guys never let me down. They're just a downright great band and fascinating!

I'm really surprised how much I like Carrie's new album.  It's been a really long time since I listened to a CD from beginning to end and really enjoyed the whole CD.  I started singing along with  many of the songs from the first time I listened.  I think there are several #1 hits on this album.  I think her cover of Randy Travis "I told You So" is absolutely fantastic. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who likes good music!

Positives:1. Britney's back with her first really good album.2. The album is very upbeat, danceable, and fun. It features pretty strong material and there's no bubblegum pop here.3. The album is pretty even in style and sound.4. Britney seems to know what she's doing on here. I'm glad she's taking credit for being a exective producer on this album.5. This album makes up for her dreadful MTV performance.Negatives:1. "Freakshow."2. "A Song About You", "Everybody", "State Of Grace", and "Let Go" didn't make the final cut.3. Britney's personal life will make people turn the other way.

I've only ever paid for one other Britney album in my life and that was her "B in the Mix" album where all her top songs were techno-ed out. I loved it because I mostly only listen to dance/club music. When I had heard some of the leaked songs off of her new album "Blackout", I thought that I might just have to shell out 10 bucks and support some good dance music. This album is nothing like anything she has done before and like most people are saying, it is a VERY WELL produced album. The beats, mixes, and vocals come together excellently and it makes every single song on this album listen-able. Some GREAT songs that I JUST CAN'T stop listening to are:1. Gimme More- It's just flippin awesome!2. Piece of Me- I love: "I'm Mrs. 'Oh My God that Britneys shameless'"2. Break the Ice- I think this is my favorite! Beat is awesome, has that 'slave for you' panting lol3. Get Naked- I could dance to this all night, produced by Danja (same as Gimme more)4. Freakshow- HOTTTTT azz song! Encore!5. Hot as Ice- This is a really cool song, its sound is unique and really fun!! One of my favvvvs.6. Ooh Ooh Baby- Sexy track! Good sound and vocals!I really don't care to pay attention to Britney's personal life. I've honestly never really loved her or her music, although I did think she was an amazing dancer in the past and respected that. I just have to recognize good dance music when I hear it. If you like to dance/party/have fun, this album is for you. You really can just put this CD on and have a good time and let it play all the way through. I do have to wonder though, when Britney was going into the studio and laying down the vocals and listening to the finished tracks, how wasn't that enough to straighten her out? This is exciting stuff and I hope her next single and video are more like the Britney I hear on this CD!

The album "Magic" is a nice return to the more rock oriented songs that Bruce and the E Street Band rode to mass market appeal. It is not another "Born to Run" or "Darkness", but so what? It is a collection of well written, well played, beautifully produced songs by one of the true legends of rock'n roll. The "hidden track" might be my favorite song on the album. "Magic" is a great addition to the Springsteen catalog. If you are a Bruce fan, you will not be disappointed. The more I listen, the more I like it.

After 2004's somewhat disappointing "Deja Vu", John Fogerty has returned with what has to be one of the best works he has done and released in a long time. 1997's "Blue Moon Swamp" was a Fogerty masterpiece, and so is this one. There is a reason the new CD is called "Revival". All throughout we are given traces of Fogerty's CCR hey day. This CD has to be one of the best of the year. The kind they don't make too much of anymore. Thankk god Fogerty is still here. Lyrically, the songs are up to snuff with some of his classics, and are an improvement over "Deja Vu". Content wise, the new disc finds Fogerty steaming mad about the President and the war, as is painfully obvious on the track "Long Dark Night", calling Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld by name, and the less than 2 minute track, "I Can't Take It Anymore", a blistering rock and roll track in the classic Fogerty sense that takes aim at Bush and calls him "another fortunate son". Elsewhere, Fogerty seems to take aim, and issue, at all the young celebrities nowadays on the also less than 2 minute song, "It Ain't Right". It's another short but sweet tune that echoes short and sweet rockers of days gone by. Great, fun song. The CD starts off on a pleasant and wonderful note with "Don't You Wish It Was True". It has a "Proud Mary" vibe to the opening musically, and the rest sort of recalls "Who'll Stop The Rain" and "Have You Ever Seen The Rain" in a way. It's a wonderful song, and the catchy chorus could of come from any Creedence song from the 60's or early 70's. This is definitley a man who has found his voice and writing again from that era. Elsewhere, "Creedence Song" is the one song here that if any captures the old sound of his band, this is it. Swampy in it's rock, and classic in it's playing and singing, this is another gem on a CD loaded with them. "River Is Waiting" is a soulful, gospel-ish track that is hauntingly pretty and memorable. "Summer Of Love" is John paying homage to Hendrix, Cream, and the like. He had a similar song on his last album called "In The Garden", but this one is a hundred times better. Capturing the right feel, tone, and rock, this is another keeper. It rocked my socks off. "Natural Thing" has John getting rocky and funky in a tune that vocally reminds me of Elvis in a way. I may also be in the minority here, but I didn't have much interest in "Broken Down Cowboy", even tho it's a nice tune. Same goes for "Somebody Help Me". "Longshot" closes the album in an upbeat, rockin' way. It's a classic sounding rock song. Folks, what we have here is a rock and roll legend and master getting back to doing what he does best. The CD showcases a man staying true to himself, his roots, and what he does. Musically and lyrically, it has Fogerty better than ever. Then there is the voice. Nobody sounds like John. Plain and simple. Here, he sounds refrshed, rejuvenated, and half his age. His voice continues to amaze. Bottom line is that 'Revival' is a great Fogerty record in a career filled with them. One of the best of 2007. I smell a Grammy.

A warning to purchasers. The sound on this cd is so overproduced, it's terrible. He has such a weak and ordinary voice that he is completely covered up by the high end production of the instrumentation. especially the bass. I spent more time adjusting the setttings on my stereo than I did listening to the music. The late Richard Manual, Dylan, Levon Helm or even Tom Waits could pull this off, but not this guy.

In my first listen, this album has completely blown me away!  I can't wait to get more into it.  There are a ferw songs that jump out right away.  First, "House By the Sea"... then "Wolves (Song of the Shepherd's Dog)" is even better!  I am a huge fan of "Our Endless Numbered Days" CD, and this CD appears to be even better.  BUY IT!!!

While I don't think any album can close to the genius that are The Colour and The Shape and There is Nothing Left to Lose, EPSC comes close. I agree with others that this album is what In Your Honor should have been. You can tell that the album flows better, has a good mix of songs and is reminiscent of the Foo's earlier work. But, Honestly evokes the same built up tension that New Way Home does. The riff at the end of Honestly is just awesome. Let it Die, The Pretender, Cheer Up Boys, Long Road to Ruin, and Stranger Things are other favorites. While I love a ton of the songs off the last two albums (All My Life is the best rocker of all), this ALBUM captures a lot of what turned me on to the Foos in the first place.

First off I must lament the same as others are about this not being a full release.  But I am also one of the first to admit that their new songs with the exception of one are all excellent and up to par with Matchbox Twenty standards.  When I first heard their new song How Far We've Come I was enamored with it and listened to it constantly.  Although it was a bit rough in parts it was still very catchy with the always heart felt singing of Rob Thomas at the helm.  Two of my favorite tracks though are I'll Beleive You When and Can't Let You Go.  Both delve into a bit of new territory with I'll Believe You When being kind of a jazzy Maroon 5 meets Matchbox Twenty song and Can't Let You Go being kind of a throw back to 50s big band kind of styling and writing.  Both are a bit of departure and make Rob Thomas' talents in writing and composing stand out.  After all, you have to admit that without Rob Thomas Matchbox Twenty is nothing.  Sad but true, he is the creative force behind this band.  All that said, I think the cd is well worth the money since you not only get the greatest hits but also six brand new songs.  A bit of a disappointment since I would've liked a full new album, but still pleasing nonetheless.

This is a decent album, but I, for one, am getting really tired of being lectured on politics by rock stars, movie stars, preachers and everyone else.  I don't give a rat's behind what John Fogerty thinks about Iraq, and his pomposity in thinking that anyone does care detracts from the album.  There are a handful of good songs, but too much garbage.

What is it with American bluegrass ladies and old English bluesrockers?Earlier this year, I watched Gillian Welch and John Paul Jones on stage.Gillian and Alison are two of the very best American Singersand Led Zeppelin was my favorite band in the early seventies So it's no wonder that I really looked forward to this album.But I was a little disappointed after all the great reviews.Alison's singing is always fantastic and she should stay with this kind of music, instead of collabrations with boring Nashville stars. I especially like "Through The Morning, Through The Night" by Gene Clark and Tom Waits' "Trampled Rose".Plant's cover versions here are not neccesary. The originals are better, whether it's by Benny Spellman or The Everly Brothers.But "Please Read The Letter" is a very good Page & Plant song.This makes me a little optimistic with regards to their future.However the harmony here could be sung by anybody, so I don't understandwhy so many think the voices blend so well.Alison, after your next fantastic Union Station CD , try an albumwith this type of music all by yourself (you can use same producer andwhoever on harmony) and maybe you'll have your own "Wrecking Ball".

I downloaded this album the day it came out and I immediately put it on my iPod to listen to at work.  It's so relaxing and it has put me in the Christmas spirit in MID-OCTOBER! I wish he included "Believe" from Polar Express though.  That song gives me the chills.  Overall, I recommend this album to anyone who loves Christmas and loves Josh Groban.

The foo fighters did it again.  They made another great sounding album.  All of the songs are great and they do not sound all the same which is good.  When you think that they can not come up with any more great original sounding music they do it again.  One of the best cd purchases that I have made.

So I have to say it...this is pretty much your typical Foo Fighters album.  The songs are tightly arranged, with softer, slow sections juxtaposed with loud, rocking sections.  Dave Grohl continues to write some memorable songs and good melodies, but if you're not listening very closely some of the songs will start to blend into each other (again...there seems to be a bit of a formula at work here).  The songs do stick in your head and I like Dave's confessional, emotional, straightforward lyrics.  I did catch the Foo Fighters on Saturday Night Live the other night and all I can say is, the band is TIGHT.  They played the heck out of The Pretender.  So overall, this is an enjoyable, albeit a bit poppy alternative CD, where you pretty much know what you're getting in advance (I would love to see Grohl take a few more risks next time).

I love it.  Like many I have waited for this.  Fewer it appears have any idea how this came about or who Leadbelly is or T-Bone Burnett for that matter.  Amazon does not say this is Bambi meets King Kong, only that that would be an odder pairing.  Krauss has been known for "offending" those who would pin her to a genre.  On this album she may pull off the gloves permanently.  Plant has some fun traveling back to the days before three chord guitars and screaming ruled the charts.A friend was concerned that, based on some early sound samples, this would be a Krauss album with Plant just harmonizing.  Well each takes a turn on lead and in some unexpected places.  The "eject" on my car CD player broke just after placing this disc in.  This may be the only album I get to listen to while driving for a while!

Too keep it short,a real good album.For me,not as good as his last with E Street,"The Rising",but nonetheless good stuff.The standouts...Radio Nowhere,You'll Be Comin' Down,Your Own Worst Enemy,Girls In Their Summer Clothes and Last To Die. It follows the standard E Street,Bruce formula,which is always good.You like Bruce,which I'm sure you do,if you read this. Check it out..It is worth the buying.Solid 4 stars for me.Not quite a classic,but it will be remembered.

Sure this album has songs about the bayou and war, nothing new to the back catologue of Fogerty, but it is set with more recent political focus, and fresher sound.  Overall, this album breaks no new territory for Fogerty, but it continues the solidification of his path to the rock and roll hall of fame.  Favorite songs are Gunslinger, Creedence Song, Long Dark Night, and It Ain't Right.  A bonus track at a major retailer was a live version of Sweet Hitch Hiker, nice track to add.  Overall, country and rock blend we expect, and a few tunes to hum all day.  Check this out, but if check out Centerfield or Blue Moon swamp for his best solo works.

Its difficult to critique this artist because her voice is so stellar. In the past, she's matched that voice with great material and the results have been incredible. The Hurting Time from her last album Bare could be the best thing she's ever done. But somethings not right with this cd. Her voice, with all its rage, earnestness and sincerity is certainly there, but it can't seem to compensate for what is essentially weak material. Not one track on this record impressed or captivated me. The worst offender could be the one most hyped, Sing, which, despite its socio/political intentions is, quite frankly, annoying as hell to listen to. Even the track Smithereens, which I intially thought to be a great record, now leaves me bored and disinterested, I read this record was written and recorded in a short time period, apparently to capture the moment of creation and performance. This may be so, but to these ears, the songs just feel half formed and half baked, with more attention to  songcraft and production values needed to ensure they live on.

I actually went to Target and bought the cd. I am pretty impressed. The songs are upbeat and danceable. I can workout to them. My favorite is track # 1, 2, 4, and 9 (Hot as Ice, I think). I miss the old Britney, the pre-Federline Britney. I hope the success of the CD will help bring her back to the good ol' ways.

This album is a must-have! I've always loved Britney, her music, her status and her persona deeply and I must say that each album surprises me a lot and so far I've really enjoyed all of them. But this one is absolutely mind-blowing! Highly inspired, wonderfully arranged, amazingly produced, each track is absolutely beautiful, edgy and innovative. It's clear that, along with her producers, she worked really hard to get a final sound that is chiseled and vocals that are perfect. And the lyrics are not just fun-filled. Some of them are quite deep and introspective. It's hard for me to say which are my favorite songs, because I like them all, but if I really had to choose, I'd signal "Piece Of Me", "Heaven On Earth" and "Get Naked (I Got A Plan)". I think that it will win over even her harshest critics. Simply her best record ever and undoubtedly the best album of the year!

JOHN FOGERTY'S "REVIVAL"! JOHN FOGERTY - being the vocalist (and, man, what a voice!), lead guitarist, songwriter and record arranger/producer - contributed more to making the records of CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL than most "solo" artists contribute to their records.  Elton John, for example, does not write the lyrics to his songs.  Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney, Rod Stewart, James Taylor, etc, etc do not produce their own records (and it is the record producer who largely determines the sound of the record).  So when CCR broke up in 1972, odds seemed strong that JOHN FOGERTY would continue on as a solo artist where CREEDENCE left off and continue making that super-cool swamp rock music for many many years.  But, to the disappointment of rock and roll fans everywhere, new JOHN FOGERTY music came very sparingly in the 35 years since then.  John has explained in so many words that various business matters had a detrimental effect on his ability to connect with his songwriting muse.Well, folks, I am extremely delighted to say that in the year 2007 JOHN FOGERTY has reconnected with his muse more solidly than he has since the heyday of CREEDENCE.  John's new album REVIVAL bristles with more deliciously chooglin' swampy countrified rock and roll than we've seen since the classic album COSMO'S FACTORY!!  Whether you're a little bit country or a little bit rock and roll - BUY THIS ALBUM!!  YOU WILL SIMPLY LOVE IT!!!MR. TWANG

I simply can't add anything to all of the wonderful reviews on this site, except to concur and say Paul Potts should do even greater things, in time.  This CD was created quickly to sell while popular opinion is high, but there is something so very special about his voice, and I truly hope that he is put on a genuine path to personal and professional growth and perfecting his talent, instead of just becoming a flash in the pan.  I shall keep checking Amazon.com for more CD's from Mr. Potts.  Thank you, Simon Cowell, and now, please take Paul Potts a few steps further.

I am a huge Kid Rock Fan.  I have all of his albums and even some really early stuff.RNR Jesus is junk!  I'm sorry to say that this is a sell out album much like Metalicca when they sold out and went soft.  The lyrics don't flow, the music is choppy.  I am not a fan of this album.RNR Jesus is decent in the beginning but ends weak.  Amen is horrible.  The only other decent song on the album is the Blues song about New Orleans (not sure of the title).I agree with the person who said this was a production album written for Kid Rock.  Waited 3 years for this?  Don;t buy the whole album...go to ITunes and buy only 2 songs.  I bought the album for $7.99 and I wish I had my $6 back.

Ok so when I first listened to kid rock he seemed sort of juvenile. Like ICP  or weezer, That is why this album blew me away it has such depth, the  arrangement of songs is perfect.  It covers his excellent ability to blend   hillbilly rock to rap to punk and the best song is adult contemporary  song "roll on". If u buy one rock album buy this one!!

What can one say about Annie Lennox that hasn't already been said?  Just listen to any track -especially "Big Sky", and hear vocal brilliance.  Her singing overall is superlative.  These are probably the most varied and most beautiful vocals she's ever done on one album.  The writing is also quite good. It's been almost 25 years since Sweet Dreams, and Annie's voice still thrills like no other!  In fact, I think it's gotten better.  Buy this cd now!

In a world NO talent classless artists, who are more famous for their taudry lifestyles and embarrasing fiascos, like Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton, and others like them, thank God we still have Annie Lennox and others like her, to trully enjoy. Miss Lennox is a true class act, one of the most respected musical geniuses there ever was. This new album is beyond outstanding. Buy it, you won't be dissapointed!

Wonderful CD, showcasing the amazing voice of new discovery, Paul Potts! Song selections are many of my favorites. Even if you don't care for Opera, you can't help but enjoy listening to this incredible artist. And the addition of two Christmas songs, makes it an even better "must have", for anyone who appreciates a really good voice.A very relaxing cd as well, for one to just listen and enjoy.

John Fogerty has always been at his best when it seemed as if he was creating music that was effortless and coming from a joyful place. This is about as effortless and joyful as it gets. The great songs are plentiful with "Natural Thing," "Longshot," "River is Waiting," and "Broken Down Cowboy" being highlights. After all these years, Mr. Fogerty is writing music that rivals his CCR days. It is an exciting thing to witness. You will seriously enjoy this album!

If we never heard anything about her personal life she would be great. Since it's popular to bash her I was ready hear how this album tanked but it is good.  Can't hate when there is nothing to hate. She has heavy back up and it's not as polished as her other work but hey! they wanted her to hang herself and she didn't despite any support.  I think this is the last we will hear from her before she commits suicide.  So enjoy our last Britney ride.

I really expected an album that was going to just plain suck to be honest. I have never owned one Britney Spears CD in my life but after hearing Gimme More on the Radio for the past month or so I decided to pick up this CD. I was very impressed particularly with "Piece of Me" and I don't think she could have done a better job. She has transformed from soft late 90's pop to the hip-hop pop that is popular today in the same way that Justin Timberlake has. With this I realize that she does in fact have a chance to bounce back more than ever. I admit her personal choices are not the greatest, but for someone here for the music, the CD is amazing.

This is, indeed, a strong piece of work from John Fogerty.  As others have noted, there is some of the energy from his prime days, lyrics that ring true for listeners (at least this listener).  The simple straight ahead music and his voice playing with the words.  It all works nicely.The CD begins with a wistful song, "Don't You Wish It Was True."  The recurring lines: "Don't you wish it was true."  A counterpoint to his hopes, expressed in lines such as "There'll be no more armies, no more hate"; "Everybody under the sun was happy just to live as one."  And so on.  The end result is a sense of being hopeful and regretful at the same time."Creedence Song" appears to look back at the days of Creedence Clearwater Revival.  The final line for each verse is the phrase "If you play a little bit of that Creedence song."  A happy ending to this tune!"Summer of Love" begins with heavy electric guitar work.  The focus is on the summer of love, when "Freedom was in the air," with "Flower children lookin' for the truth." An interesting song, again looking back.A final example of the work in this CD is a topical song, "I Can't Take It No More."  He begins with the title, then sings "Sick and tired of your dirty little war," and "You know you lie about the casualties, You know you lied about the WMDs." An angry, swift paced song. The final verse features lines that typify the song: "Your daddy wrote a check and there you are, another fortunate son."This represents a strong bit of work from John Fogerty.  For his fans, this will be a good addition to their library.  For those not necessarily his fans, it is a strong effort on his part and well worth listening to.

On a remix of Jadakiss' Why, Common pondered, "Why they hype Britney up, they know she cant sing?" The simple answer was she could sell albums. Back when she was the number one pop princess she got the best songwriters, producers, and chorographer and elaborate stage shows. But all those people a currently working with the likes of Rihanna and the Pussycat Dolls. So instead of working with someone like Timbaland, Britney had to settle for a Timbaland lackey Nate Hills to help write and produce half of the songs on Blackout which come out sounding just a step above the Paris Hilton album. What's worse if he starts speaking over Gimme More talking about how amazing Britney is. Who does he think he is, Puff Daddy? At least Diddy had a few actually hit under his belt before he pulled that stuff.Without Max Martin or Diane Warren around, the lyrics are even worse than stale beats. E-Mail My Heart seems Dylanesque compared to some of the songs on Blackout. Piece of Me is Britney's backlash at the press and paparazzi which would have been a little more meaningful had she actually had a hand in writing it. Hot as Ice, co-written by T-Pain, is just one cheesy metaphor after another. And yes she also mentions in the song that she is also "Cold as fire." Then Get Naked (I Got a Plan) and Freakshow, where Britney inexplicably raps, will most likely be Exhibit U and V in Kevin Federline's plan to get full custody.The songs basically are just one bad techno track bleeding into each other which may work at a rave while on mind altering drugs, but for those of you that are sober, the album is as bad as you could expect. But at least Britney can in solace that it is better than her ex-husband's. But not by much. Here is usually where I suggest a song to download but you are better off saving your money. Unless of course you are one of those annoying semi-ironic people, then go ahead and get the "It's Britney (expletive deleted)" ringtone so you can be the biggest tool on your block.

Once again Bruce shows his gift of poetry with words and music.He can make everyday thoughts and actions into thought provoking experiences. If you don't want to go down that road,  there is just great music filled withdriving energy and Bruce's passionate filled vocal and guitar talent.

The best description of this musical came from Joel Grey who played the original cast's Wizard of Oz. He said Wicked is "a thinking man's Disney show that has more intelligence...wit and sophistication."Wicked's music is highly engaging and this Original Cast Album has two incredible female leads Idina Menzel as Elpheba and Kristin Chenoweth as Glinda. The most memorable numbers are The Wizard and I, What is this Feeling, Popular, the show stopping Defying Gravity, No Good Deed and For Good, which always brings tears to my eyes.My deep "Gratitution" to Stephen Shwartz, Marc Platt, Winnie Holzman for creating this musical and ofcourse to Gregory Maguire who wrote the book that inspired it!

I am a trained musician, singer, music history buff and a major nit picker.  I almost find it impossible to listen to any singer's solo album all the way through because I get distracted by the imperfections.  As a result, I stick to orchestral and instrumental music for the most part.  Nonetheless, this man's voice captures my senses and allows me (for once) to enjoy vocal music for the sheer joy and emotion communicated through sound.  Paul Potts is somehow able to give me goosebumps and, miraculously, his voice brings tears to my eyes.

I am not sure where I heard the recommendation to preorder this album but now that I am just getting around to listening to it, I'd have to agree with the statement that this is only an album big Fogerty/CCR fans will love. I in fact would probably include myself as a big CCR fan and even I find the album "average." I like the CCR feel of the album (which I assume lends itself to the title of the album as in a revival of Creedence Clearwater Revival)compared to say "Centerfield." But I think "Centerfield" is a better album. And so are the previous CCR works. I doubt whether any songs on the album get much air play. "Revival" has a solid line up of good songs but no hits or home runs. And although an album doesn't have to be full of "hit" singles to be a great album, I don't think this album as a whole quite makes it into the "great" catagory either. Bottom line for prospective buyers I'd say is buy the album if your are a fan of Creedence Clearwater Revival but don't expect a ground stomping revival. Everyone else should avoid the album.

It's been a while since I've listened to a new album, over and over again. I'm a huge fan of the Foo's debut album, which is still my favorite of all the Foo albums. This one, for me, takes second only to the debut. My favorite track on the Album is "Let it Die." To me, the track seems to channel the souls of Genesis and YES, and it definitely works. I'm not an audiophile, and I'm sure I lack the proper vocabulary to do this Album justice, but just let me say that the entire album is more than satisfying, and extremely listenable. A welcome return to the roots of Foo, after what I felt to be a sub par outing on the last double-album (so sub par that I can't even remember the name of it).

I feel like I need to respond to the negative reviews.  I didn't expect that kind of feedback from people who sound like they're fans of Annie.  She puts her heart and mind totally into a project and gets slammed.  Nice.  I listened to this for a week before release on VH1 and was just blown away.  Her writing and voice are continuing to improve with age.  The music is beautifully produced.  Thank you Annie for the joy you give me with your music.  The haters can suck it.

In 1967 or 68 the very first album I bought was an eight track version of Green River[[ASIN:B000000XCD Green River] which I played until the tape broke so I admit to being biased.  I have just downloaded Revival, burned it to disc, and listened. I have just finished the audition and am compelled to give 5 stars. It's about time John Fogarty got back to the roots.The production is not over done and Fogarty still has the pipes. Not only that, but he still has something to say. This album delivers!!!

Quite honestly, the Springsteen cds I like are Nebraska and Tom Joad. The rest of his ouvre is somehow sonic overkill, emotional histrionics and hamfisted fractured metaphors. There is no doubt that the guy and his team can generate heat, especially in the NYC and North Jersey environs. Up here in the Maritimes, it is a little less convincing, and I don't know that that is always Springsteen's fault. THis one, as with many before it, suffers from too much hype. And I mean really suffers.I have read a lot of reviews, including the adulating Rolling Stone, and was ready for something transformative. No such luck. It's all about losers from North Jersey wondering where they are in their lives, and while I get it, let's just say this isn't Charles Bukowski.The one exception is the paean to his friend who has passed away. That hits with a lightning bolt. The songs are all boilerplate Springsteen. Working class, with a farm in the Jersey highlands and a daughter copeting in horseshows, he is still convincing enough. Where he is done a disservice id in both the production and the public perception. It seems his persona as the straightline descendant of Frank Sinatra and Frankie Valli with a Phil Spector aesthetic doesn't, or rarely allows him to get across what he really intends, Born in the USA being the perfect example. Radio Nowhere here has a point about the lack of communication that is undermined by its radio-friendly dance beat. This safe and comfortable E Street bomblast, regardless of the lyrics. And I am not sure Springsteen is capable of expressing it otherwise. Even the Seeger stuff was channeled through a wall of noise. Perhaps it isn't possible to use subtlety and nuance in the same sentence with New Jersey, but then, Bill Evans managed it. Everything else just always seems so over the top, as in "Come here, Wendy!" All blue collar and no play makes jack.....Anyway, if you romaticize about the Jersey shore enough and love that honking sax music, this record has it all in spades.  But there isn't a "Point Bank" or a song about the prejudice of NY cops or even the dismay of a post 9-11 New Yorker on offer here. No doubt the Garden will be sold out for 15 nights. I came looking for magic and felt somewhat fleeced.

I love me some Annie like no tomorrow- and REALLY tried to get into this album!  After so long, I just found it difficult to digest.  The only memorable tracks on her are 'Love is Blind', 'Ghosts in my Machine, and 'Coloured Bedspread'.  The rest just seem to get lost in oblivion, and 'Sing' is just plain bad (though the intentions behind it were genuine and creditworthy.)Put it this way. After listening to a couple of tracks, I would find myself returning to the Bare album, which blows me away each time I listen.  There's nothing like her tracks 'Hurting Time' and 'Honestly' to really bring me back to full circle with Annie. Disappointing. Not catchy enough.  Not 'bare' enough. But still love Annie regardless.

I've had some time to allow for this album and newest release from Bruce to sink in...and it hasn't.  There are some good moments, such as the opening cut and Girls in Their Summer clothes and a few others, but most of it, unfortunately, sounds like a retread of grounds already explored by Springsteen.  I'm not even going to enter into the discussion about the production, which is horrible.  If I were to review sound as well as the music I would have to deduct one star, at least.  Some of these songs sound like leftovers from The Rising.  It's not a bad CD by any means, but it doesn't rise above average very often, hence the 3 stars.  If you're a diehard you will find some things to like or perhaps even many.  As a casual fan, this is nowhere to go roaming.

I am a huge Annie Lennox fan and love that magnificent, honey laced voice of hers. At its best it soars like and eagle and dives live a whale. I love the album, SOMD, and the standout tracks for me are: Dark Road, Smithereens which I think is tied for best song on the album, Through The Glass Darkly, Lost which is the second song tied for best on the album, Big Sky, and Fingernail Moon. I am still waiting for Annie to progress from this melancholy, heartbroken phase and experience the sunshine again. There was a time when her music was fun like, Right By Your Side and I Need a Man. I hope the next album has more upbeat and happier songs than the dark and sometimes depressing, which still sounds beautiful but it's becoming the predominant mood of her albums. Lighten up Annie!!!

Not only is this a terrible title for this collection, but it's not even original.  MB20 swiped the title from the Jerry Spider Band.  The comparison to the Rolling Stones' brilliant album "Exile on Main Street" is ludicrous.  The Stones, in their day, were the hardest rocking blues band working, and the album "Exile on Main Street" is generally thought to be their masterpiece.  In contrast, "Exile on Mainstream" is neither MB20's best work, nor is it hard rocking blues.  MB20 has always been a soft pop band, far closer in spirit to Herman's Hermits than the Rolling Stones.  A far better title would have been "There's a Kind of a Mush All Over the World."  It's a real pity, too, because these guys are obviously quite talented musicians.  One wishes they'd stop playing to the teenage girls, though, and really let go for a change.  I can imagine the adulation of countless girls is wonderful to have, but that shouldn't preclude attempting to "push" their art beyond its comfortably easy boundaries of confessional angst and self-aggrandizement.  Where's the real music, or is this really the best they can do?  I'd love to hear an album with these cats really playing as hard as they can.  C'mon already.

Wicked is a back story to the popular story of the Wizard of Oz.  the back story places the Good Witch of the North, Galinda, and the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba, when they both attended college at Shiz University and where roommates as well as friends.  Unexpected circumstances change their fates forever but they never forget each other.  The cast brings the story to life and illustrates that compassion and friendship can breakdown all walls in the end.  I highly recommend this album to everyone.

It seems an awful lot of people here are rating this CD based on the play itself.   The play may be a wonderful thing, I wouldn't know, but the CD really isn't all that great to listen to.Wicked does have a few songs that are somewhat catchy and some which I like somewhat, but the majority of the music is a huge turnoff.   The overall sound of it is very pop-y and a lot of it sounds like pure bubblegum.    If you were irratated by some of the music from Hairspray, you may have an idea what I mean.   I can hardly stand to listen to half of the songs, which all seem to end on the same overly dramatic note.   Perhaps the music itself might not be too bad if sung by a different group of people.  The fact is that the voices of most of the characters are annoying.   Everyone in the play (excluding the protaganist) is meant to be some sort of shallow stereo-typed click-y person.  Basically the characters are designed to be detestable people, and as such they are detestable to listen to.  Even when they come together to harmonize, it's a harmony constructed of the members of some high-school drama.Every once and a while the music is able to break free of these hindrances, but even then it seems as if it is just mimicking and riding on other musicals' success.   Little seems all that original.It appears that I'm expressing a minority opinion, but I really don't think the music on this CD is worth listening to on any sort of regular basis, unlike other musicals.

I am 20 years old so I realize that I wasn't exactly "around" during Springsteen's glory days of Born To Run, Darkness On The Edge of Town, and The River.  I started following Springsteen's music when I began to play the guitar and tried to do an acoustic version of Thunder Road.  I began collecting his music after that, and currently own all of his records.  While Magic might not be as harsh, dark, and nostalgic as Born to Run or Darkness, it sure matches the songwriting quality. Say what you want about Springsteen personally. Politically egotistic, loud, overbearing...the man can write a damn good song. His ability to craft a song based on not only the emotional constraints of the person, but also the physical is unrivaled among songwriters today. Magic weaves dreary imagery and somber melodies together perfectly and while it might not provide the feeling of uplifting nostalgia as Born To Run did, it leaves you, surprisingly in a state of realization of your own self. It's the first Springsteen album thats fitting for a long drive along the shore on a cool October night. As for the songs themselves....there are a couple duds on the album. Most notably Your Own Worst Enemy and Last To Die. However Livin In The Future, Girls In Their Summer Clothes, Magic, Long Walk Home, and Terry Magovern (bonus track) are some of the best stuff Springsteen has done to date. I would have liked a couple more songs of that magnitude, and yes the sound gets a little overbearing at times. In all, however, this is an incredibly solid piece of work by a songwriter who's style refuses to fade. Hell, I dont think he'll let it fade.

This is her best cd since DIVA, and her most experimental, production wise, since Savage (IMO)!! I love it.

I really love this CD for the most part.  Josh Groban gives traditional Christmas songs new life with his beautiful voice.  Having said that, I could have done without the long distance Christmas dedications throughout track #3.  I mean, in the beginning of the song was fine.  Then I hear the wishes throughout then it changed into something else for me.  I mean, I'm in support for the Iraq troops coming home instead of risking their life for a senseless war but putting their voices on a studio song like #3...didn't work for me.  I thought I was listening to Coast FM in Southern Calif which is very cheesy with their cheesy-unrealistic dedications.  For anyone wanting to buy this J.Groban CD, go ahead 'cause the rest of the songs are totally worth it.  I should give this CD at least 4 stars but because song #3 ruined it for me, I'm giving it 3 stars.

I've read a lot of hype about this album. Got it yesterday, listened to it today. No jewel case, too bad. Overall it has the authentic Fogerty feel. His voice is as strong as ever. I need to give the album more time to settle in, but on first listen it sounds like a continuation of Blue Moon Swamp and Deja Vu All Over Again, which is not a bad thing at all. The sound quality is just a bit too gritty for my ear. Musically it's very strong. Lyrically, I could do without the political stuff (Long Dark Night & I Can't Take It No More), Just not thought-provoking or interesting, but rather trite liberal bumper stickers sung out loud. Don't You Wish It Was True is probably the strongest song. Creedence Song lacks the punch of Swamp River Days or even Wicked Old Witch. Broken Down Cowboy is a sweet melancholy tune, perhaps my favorite on the album. Summer of Love is a remake of In the Garden, stuck in the 60's mentality lyrics. It Ain't Right is a more accurate indictment of pop tarts than his previous critique of popular culture: Nobody's Here Any More. And a lot more fun too. Longshot is a strong rocker, classic Fogerty. At 41 minutes, it clocks in like a CCR LP. Between Revival and Deja Vu, minus some of the weaker tracks, together they create one great album ala Blue Moon Swamp. It does my heart good to see John keeping rock & roll alive (as much as that is even possible), and on Fantasy records no less!

The reason that so many people have complained about the sound quality of this album, is because it is mixed with the guitars turned up too loud.  The result is that it does not sound like the E Street Band. From "Born to Run" to "Born in the USA", the mix that let the E Street Band's sound come through, is one where Roy Bittan's piano, and Danny Federici's organ and Max's drums were all up in the mix. Bruce's guitars were mixed in very low. This let Bruce's vocals shine through. To be honest, Bruce's guitar playing is average at best. His simplistic licks are not going to be copied by any aspiring player. They compliment the band when turned down low, almost hidden in the mix. Even on the guitar heavy Darkness album, the guitars are set back in the mix. With Magic, the guitars are up so loud and out front that they are drowning out the rest of the band as well as being on top of Bruce's vocals. The guitar parts are so basic and uninteresting, when they are placed up front in the mix, they kill the band and the song. This album could have been a lot better with a producer who understood what made the E Street band so great in the first place.One last point, am I the only one who thinks that Radio Nowhere is a rip off of 867-5309 Jenny? The opening guitar riff is so close to that song, I think Bruce should send them royalties

The first time I heard Alison Krauss, I was in my car and she sang the song "Now that I've found you" and I was stunned. I immediately stopped the car and made sure I did not miss the presenter tell me who was singing and have been an ardent fan ever since. HOWEVER, in reading all the positive reviews on this album I suspect that many are being disingenuous. It reminded me of "The Emperors new clothes" in that not many were being truthful enough to want to put themselves on record and give an honest review. I too am a huge R.P & A.K.fan and when I heard about this album I could not wait to hear it, in fact I told all my friends that I was going to buy it and really talked it up in anticipation of something special. On first play I expected the hairs on the back of my neck to stand up as it had don the first time I heard her but I was sadly disappointed. Believe me I am an optimist and I gave it a second play hoping that it would "grow on me!"But it did not. In being loyal (even to a fault) I could have said "doesn't the emperor look wonderful in his new clothes!" as most here seem to have done. However I cannot as to do so would be disingenuous. I found it languid, uninspiring and poorly mastered. Whether this becomes a "success" will depend on the sales which I doubt will mirror the glowing reviews I have read. I suspect that will very quickly find its way into the bargain basket in the record stores. If my review gets the thumbs down from all the other reviewers then into the viliage stocks I must go ,for daring to say the emperor is as naked as the day he was born.

Very little substance. Poor song choices with poor overdone pop production. Better luck next time Carrie. The 2nd album is always hard to get right. Someone has a little success. It goes their head and then they think people will buy whatever they record. The best song is a remake of Randy Travis' I Told You So. Just A Dream is the best new song on the album. But I guess I'm biased, I'm a just a "REAL" country fan.

I found all of the songs to be really similar and the lyrics are kind of dull. Compared to Some Hearts, this is nothing. However, I must say that the last track, "Wheel Of The World", almost saves this album entirely. It's pure brilliance: Carrie sings it filled with emotion and the lyrics are beautiful. I must say that I am disappointed, though. I was expecting something better than SH and what I got was a let-down with a few songs that bear ridiculousness: "The more boys I meet, the more I love my dog?", "I'd kiss that frog"? Seriously, what?

Read all these 5-star reviews with caution; Springsteen's latest just isn't all that good, despite the wishful thinking and irrational exuberance of his faithful throng.There are a handful of decent songs here (Long Walk Home and the Devil's Arcade stand out).  But after two exploratory and brilliant CDs (Devils & Dust, The Seeger Sessions), Springsteen seems to have come home worn out and bored.  It's not just that he falls back on a formula now more than 20 years old; on Magic the writing, performances and production are all half-hearted.There's nothing like Springsteen performing live with his E Street Band, and I suspect even these songs will gain new life in the stadium.  Back in the studio, though, it seems this team may have lost its magic.

So Hott is a good song.  That's it.   Not the right name for this cd.  Also all of this fake public fighting is ridiculous.  Please!All of his other cd's are great though.

The only good thing about this movie are the Beatles themselves. The plot(and I'm being generous when I call it that ) is very weak and not funny. If everything else could be edited out except when the Beatles are  either performing or on screen by themselves then we would have something  watchable. It is way too scripted. The Beatles are at their best just being  themselves as in a Hard Days Night

Obviously this is a fantastic movie, but what about the DVD? Well, honestly, the quality is pretty bad. The film transfer isn't very pretty, it's in FULL SCREEN as opposed to its original widescreen ratio, and the sound quality is an insult for any music-based film, let alone The Beatles. <p>[...]<p>Also, this version has zippo extras. A Hard Days' Night has some nice bonus features, so surely the next Help! DVD will, as well.<p>Hold off 'till we get the good version! Just dust off your old copy of Help! on VHS, 'cos this version literally is no better.

All of Iron and Wines albums so far have been stripped bare and the songs have been as vulnerable as they have been naked.  With the Shepherd's Dog Sam Beam doesn't just add an extra instrument here and there, he adds a multitude of instruments on almost every track.  While this works wonders on some songs, "Lovesong of the Buzzard, Innocent Bones, Boy with A Coin," it is also distracting in some instances,(Wolves).  By the end of "wolves" I had almost forgotten what the song sounded like because he does some experimental instrumentation that goes on too long and doesn't add much to the song, in fact it's a little distracting.With that being said, The Shepherd's Dog is still better than almost everything else released this year.Stand out track: Flightless Bird, American Mouth -(sounds like Tenderfoot)

The Beatles were always fun to watch on TV and in A Hard Days Night.  But, HELP was really not mean't for the Beatles.  They were too sophisticated for this.  They were really not a bubble gum group.  The Beatles are always fun to watch and the songs were  always great.  But, Brian Epstein should had another film made for them.  It should stayed Eight Arms to Hold You and have been an extension of Hard Days Night showing the Beatles in real life film footage, traveling, talking, and best of all have them at real live concerts with surround stereo sound. They were playing in stadiums at that time, they should have put the Shea stadium concert on it. Anyway, I know John hated making HELP and I don't blame him.  He was an artist, not teeny bopper sex symbol.  This film must have degraded him. I believe this was what made him hate being a Beatle and made him break away years later.  Epstein should have used his head on this one.  HELP was an enormous success, but it did more harm to the Beatles than good.

First of all, Kid Rock lost when I heard the longest intro I have ever heard to a rock song followed by the first line "shes got the body of a devil and she smells like sexaaa". 2nd of all listening to the trashy over the top hook made me laugh because I know he is trying desperately to make a comeback. 3rd of all his video to the song is hillarious. It starts with a car rolling down the street and guys fighting out of nowhere. Then his car rolls up in slow motion and he gets out in slow mo with smoke coming out his mouth, lol. Then the camera zooms in on him flicking his cigar, lmao. And when the first strum of the guitar comes fireworks and lights come on behind him, funny stuff. But what topped it off, he named his album Rock n roll jesus with a song like that. Only in times like these would an album like that hit number 1 on billboard.

The music in this CD is lovely and beautifully played. Too bad all of the vocals are monotonous and tiresome. If the singer had stayed home, the artistry of the band would make this a good CD. As it is, it's annoying. Fortunately, the more you listen to it, the funnier the droning singer gets. I doubt that was the intent. Save your money. Buy something else that won't make you clench your teeth.

After watching this movie I am now convinced...Ringo Starr is an absolutely terrible actor.  His bad acting ruined this movie for me.  In the original version of Help, Mr. Starr had a cow in his room so he could drink warm milk.  I'm glad they edited out that scene because it was not even remotely funny.<p>Apart from Mr. Starr's acting, George Harrison delivers a tremendous performance.  I think it's hilarious when George Harrison is skiing with a top hat on his head.<p>Also, the title track is superb.<p>If the producers can edit out all of the scenes with Ringo Starr, this will by a 5-star movie.

To begin with I am a huge matchbox fan.  I tend to like more of the songs that do not make the radio.  There are 17 songs on the new album which is great but most of the new songs......I was a little disappointed.  Honestly matchbox could record Mary had a little lamb and I would probably buy it because they have such a unique sound and so lyrically strong.  It is possible that after 5 years and many great albums including Tabitha's Secret, my expectations were just too high.  If you are a matchbox fan you will buy the CD anyway, if this is your first matchbox experience, I would go with Yourself or Someone like you.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002JWU">Yourself or Someone Like You</a>.  Even though it is not my favorite matchbox, it is still better than most of the other music out there today

If you are an old Matchbox Twenty fan, then you should be mad that there are only six new songs here.  But, they are good songs, so you probably should buy it anyway.If you are a new Matchbox Twenty fan, then disc 2, the best of disc, is a great place to start.If you don't like Matchbox Twenty, then why are you even reading this?  Don't you have work to do?  Don't you have better things to do than sit around reading reviews of bands you don't like?

I am a very long time Bruce Springsteen fan and enjoy most everything Bruce puts on the table for us to enjoy.  I bought this cd the day it came out.  I'm enjoying the music, although the recording quality sounds pretty flat on my high quality audio system.  Then there is the package - pure garbage.  I had to return the first cd since it was scratched and skipped on track 5.  I expect the scratch occurred getting the cd into the package at the factory - or out of the package with my fingers.  Here's a message to Columbia/Sony - if you want to sell cd's - give us quality recordings of interesting music in quality packaging designed to protect the cd.  This release is only 1 out of 3 at best.  It's a shame to see Bruce's musical offerings recorded poorly - and packaged pitifully.  I would not recommend this release to anyone who cares about quality.

first off, i wanna start out by sayin that i used to be a pretty big fan of this girl (or woman). so i am not biased.altho i didn't buy the album (why would i?), i listened to it enough times to come up w/ a general idea of what this album is really like. this is my conclusion -- it is cheap and extremely superficial to the point where it's hard to stand. my question is, WHY is she still in this industry making trashy music? first, she CANNOT sing (i think no one can say 'objection' to this one). second, she seriously needs to concentrate more on the priorities of her life. i don't think she realizes that she's got children of her own now! why torture people's eardrums? bottom line is that she just can't sing (why lipsych if u can?). the way she is now just disgusts me -- it's repulsive.this album -- well... just means that her flagrant name has brought her fame. it has no talent and no meaning. Jive just wants to use her now notorious brand name to make some money...if ur definition of bad music is something that is very studio synthesized, fake, oversexed, and plain under-educated, DON'T GET THIS CD. it is not worth a penny. as if polluting the radio air waves of today's society is not enough.

WARNING! I'm one of "those people" that believe that the Super Bowl must be fixed because there's just way too much money at stake.Given this, I believe Britney's 2007 addiction, rehab, head shaving, child custody battling, MTV VMA breathless and intoxicated performance were all put in play by a PR manager that truly understands the maxim "there's no such thing as bad publicity". Let's face it, Anna Nicole Smith's massive value in pop culture land was premised on exactly this type of behavior, and she wasn't hawking an album. Need more proof? How about Paris and her CD?Nuff said about dat. The album is interesting as it tries top establish an asynchronous dialogue between Britney, you and the papparazi. The songs are decently produced and heavily remixed.My prediction is that #5 (Heaven...) will play well in the clubs and will become the hitter after a few weeks of play. It's got a good mix of Kylie Minogue dance beat and great backgrounds.Love her or hate her, she's going to pull down $10M from this easy. How you doin?

Yes, some "Magic" can be found on this cd but unfortunately that famous E-Street Band sound has been turned into a wall of mush. Bruce's vocals at times seem to be uninspired and somewhat forced and I wish it weren't so because I am a decades long Jersey fan. This cd is worth hearing but I'll be playing "The River" when I need my E-Street fix.

I'll have to use Faith Hill's line "What"? This is not what's expected from the CMA Female Vocalist of the Year. (she got lucky) Carrie could have really been creative the second time around utilizing all types of very good song writers (ie. Patty Griffin). These songs are NOT that good. The production of this album is different; it's not as polished as the first one. Her voice does sound strained; at times she's screaming not singing but the songs are awlful. Don't get me wrong I LOVED the first CD and was actually shocked it sounded that good and the songs were 1st rate. These are NOT. I vote for Leann Rimes or Mandy Barnett. She'll never compare to those two. Change direction Carrie on the next CD or you've lost a fan.

Aside from the sometimes cryptic/sometimes in your face war commentary, this album is basically nothing more than comfort food- nothing ventured, nothing gained.  The thing about comfort food: sure, we all want chicken fingers sometimes and we can sit at a low-end hole like TGIFridays and find them delicious for a minute- but then we look around and see the union workers, middle management office crap and their nowhere women who don't mind being referred to as baby or darlin' in a Bruce song because all they have ever learned of is relationship and family- yes, the same barren babes that will listen to "I'll Work for Your Love" and find it anthemic.  THESE are the people who the comfort food was made for, not you!  Get out of the restaurant!  Hurry or you will become one of them. Bruce sounding 35 again?  maybe- but he certainly can't write those old lyrics again without resorting to his own cliches.  I'll bet this will sell quite well, more than the superior Devils and Dust for sure, becasue that record was uncomfortable- those same acid washed jean wearing women can't bear to hear a song about their hero in a hotel room with a hooker, can they?  Also they can't support or condemn a war beyond their own everyday cliches like "support our troops" blah blah blah.   Bruce needs to resume writing for the educated not the downtrodden.  Nothing on here is "Lost in the Flood".

With their sixth studio album, think both discs of "In Your Honor" mashed into one 12 song disc and you have "Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace" (ESPG). Gil Norton, who helped the Foos make their finest work "The Colour And The Shape", unfortunately does not work his magic a second time out. That's not to say that there are no good songs here. There are some memorable alt.rock songs like the first single "The Pretender", but also "Erase/Replace", "Long Road To Ruin" and "Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)". There are some partially acoustic numbers that work fairly well like "Stranger Things Have Happened", the instrumental "Ballad Of The Beaconsfield Miners", "Statues" and "Home".In general, "ESPG" felt tired to me. Not as good as their earlier work, even the first disc of "In Your Honor". The trouble is I am biased in favor of the Foos. I like all six of their albums, it's just that Dave and company didn't really stretch themselves this time. They played it safe, right down to obtaining their former hit producer Gil Norton. Three and a half stars is my vote. The band really needs to try something different next time. Surprise us.

When I saw the inital performance of Paul Potts on television, I was so impressed that bought this CD...to be honest, I'm a bit disappointed. Overall, while his voice is impressive, it's not as polished an instrument as I'd hoped to hear. His personal story is compelling and he's very 'down to earth.' He will definitely be launched now on his career -- not sure that he's going to be 'top tier.' Perhaps it's a mistake for him to be singing pieces closely associated with Luciano Pavarotti - whose recent death had tv/radio stations playing his best-known pieces...the inevitable comparison shows that Potts is not at LP's level.

I hate to say it, but this is Britney's WORST album.  The lyrics are horrible, with no significant messages at all.  I've heard several of her other albums, and they had great lyrics and musical notation.  The beats are off and the songs don't flow AT ALL.  It's very possible that the producer and Britney were both on nerve medication, which distorted their perception of what IS good.  I bought this because so many people were giving rave reviews, even on Rolling Stones.  I'm sick.  I paid $15 for this piece of plastic.  The only good thing out of that CD was the sample of her new fragrance.  I already sold the CD on e-bay.  DON'T BUY IT!!

This is not a bad CD for what it's supposed to be, and that is a bunch of good beats with over processed vocals. But this shouldn't surprise anyone because every album she's put out has used catchy beats with subpar vocals. On this album she does what she's good at which is pretty much give the people who buy her music what they really want. "Gimme" is a good example and so are songs like "Piece of Me", "Hot as Ice", and even the forgettable "Heaven on Earth". I wouldn't call this a comeback CD because it doesn't seem as if she is doing anything different than she did before. But I have to say most of the songs are dance worthy and the hooks, while not the best lyrics ever written, are still catchy and you'll find yourself singing along. The beats also help too. Lastly, I rate this 3 stars because most of the tracks don't explore new territory but are still fun to move to.

I love the new songs, so I'm not going to spend time going over them one by one. My beef is with the production of the CD. How is it possible for EVERY instrument to be playing at exactly the same level throughout every song, throughout the entire CD? The music is SO compressed that at times I can barely hear the vocals. There's an organ in there somewhere- I thought I heard it. Guitar solos... I hear something, but I can't make out the riff. Sax, snare, bass-- all sounding as if they're being played through a funnell. Was this mixed for AM Radio??I know there has been chatter about CD's being issued too hot, too loud, but this is ridiculous. And I don't care if it's Springsteen's "signature" sound - this CD goes over the line. As great as the songs are, its painful to listen to them. How bout a 5.1 mix to open it up? It would be great to hear the drums and bass and organ and guitar and vocals--- instead of just drumsbassorganguitarvocals !

Some Hearts is one of the best albums I ever did listen to. I just never grow tired of it and when I take a short journey in my car I always wish it could've been longer since I don't get to hear most of the tracks.So anyway back to Carnival Ride. Ok so lame title! That out of the way. So Small could easily have been named "So BLAND". Some nice enough tunes on here for sure but thats half the problem with the new disk. I don't want nice, I want awesome. Where's Jesus Take The Wheel? Where's Lessons Learned? Where's Night Before (Life Goes On) and I can go on and on...That said Carrie is still a beautiful woman.

Britney Britney Britney..Why can't you just make good music?This is ten times worse than her previous efforts, and it's sad to say this album has no standouts.When one of the best songs is "Gimme More," a very mediocre pop song, you know something is wrong.1 star Britney, you'll need to do more to get back to your long gone status.

The first seven songs are overproduced with the E-Street Band sounding manic. These songs lack decent melodies and contain tepid and poorly rhyming lyrics (Springsteen is no poet). The eighth song "Magic" is a great song in every respect, one worthy of the Springsteen legend. The one that follows, "Last to Die" is a powerful anti war statment on Iraq. "Long Walk Home" which follows is flawed with awkward lines and comes nowhere close to "My Home Town" on his greatest album, "Born in the USA". "Devil's Arcade" has a slightly off putting melody and vocal but is lyrically interesting. My CD has a bonus track "When They Broke the Mold" and nice folk sounding song about the death of a friend. I would put five other Springsteen albums above this one.

I'm sorry, but I just can't get behind this release.  I like a lot of the Springsteen's work, but this is beyond me.  The people complaining about the mixing job and the overproduction are correct.  It seems like the Boss and band are just adapting to new age production techniques that are just not necessary.  The lead off single is "Radio Nowhere" which is a terribly generic sounding rock song that sounds like it could have been done by Green Day (or some band like them).  This is not what I was expecting from the BOSS. Also over the years Bruce seemed to develop this problem with singing through his teeth or mumbling.  I can't get the words to well half the time which is a shame as he has wrote some amazing lyrics in the past.  This problem is more evident on the rocker songs.  If I had to pick the "best" couple songs I'd say "Livin' In the Future" and "Magic" (Which reminded me a bit of "I'm on Fire").  Even with those songs the overproduction is evident.  I really don't see this release holding up to many repeat listens before going back in the drawer.  Sorry.

I'm a lifelong fan of Bruce and was really looking forward to this new rock offering. Some of the early buzz suggested a "return to form". I wish I hadn't bothered! With the exception of a couple of outstanding tracks, the rest of the album sounds awful with terrible production. Brendan O'Brien's wall of sound just doesn't cut it. I expected a much more raw and gritty sound to go with the songwriting. The first four or five tracks all seem to sound the same. It's like hearing the band playing through a wall. It gets a little better after that, but again the over-produced sound makes the listening experience rather disappointing. Can't wait for the remastered release of Darkness on the Edge of Town!

I was anxiously awaiting this CD.  I think that Bruce is one of the greatest songsmiths in the business today.  But, this (IMHO) has to be one of the muddiest sounding albums in recent memory.  I can't understand the vocals (sure I could read the libretto however that's somewhat difficult while driving) and the instruments of this phenomenal group of seasoned musicians are indistinctly mashed together.  It's almost unlistenable and somewhat frustrating as I ask myself why anyone who can certainly afford the best would put this out as is.  My disappointment is not with the content but with the presentation that clouds what should be an exciting release.

I have just received my much anticipated copy of Raising sand. I listened carefully to each song; read many of the positive and negitive reviews and then listened again. I really love what allison has done with union station ( saw them in concert this summer in Kansas City ) and have a half dozen of their albums. Robert Plant; of course, is an Icon in Rock music and a review of his past work is not nessasary.   Together; they are    JUST AWFUL !!! The songs are not even close to a match for their voices or any style. Did some one flip a coin ? This is the worse album I have purchased this year ! I really wanted to be surprised and like this ! I was SURPRISED ! What a incredible waste of talent... 1 star is a reach  !

Dear Mr. Bruce Springsteen,Although this release is full of great material please remaster this album.  The sound quality appears as if something produced during the 50's.

Everything by Annie lennox is a disappointment after her "Medusa" album years ago.  She perfectly nailed all the material on that CD.  Except for the first song,this entire CD is drab, boring drivel...at least for my taste.  Nothing on here showcases her incredible vocal talents.  I should have been suspicious when most CD websites only provided a sample listen of the first song.  PASS THIS ONE UP!!!

Let me first give a brief history of my fascination with Carrie.    The night I watched her sing "Alone" on American Idol, I was in love. I knew she'd win and was excited about the album she'd make.     Skip ahead a few months to her album's release. I was saddened when I found out it was country and decided not to buy it.    Skip ahead another few months; my mom had the album and I listened to some of the songs... fell in love all over again. I bought the album and loved 80% of the songs on it. Such passion and feeling, and not as country as I expected. "Starts With Goodbye" was my favorite song.    At that point I thought that if this was the music niche she'd take part in, I could definitely handle it. Country-Pop and ballad heavy kinda. So I anticipated this musical style with her second album, after listening to "So Small" extensively; well I was sorely disappointed when I found out she is now more country than ever. The weird southern country singer accent that didn't exist in most of the first album, found its way in this entire album and, at times, it is just too much to take.    Expect her next album to have banjos and washboards.

I couldn't agree more with the last couple of reviews.  When I listened to this cd the first time in my car I had to play it at home right away because I wasn't sure if it was my lousy car speakers or the music itself.  From a sheer sound quality, the word muddy is a perfect fit, and from a musical quality, it seems really forced, both in lyrics and instrumentally.  Many times too, it seems like they all thought they needed to be playing at the same time, which again, gave the overall sound a muddy quality.  I am a huge Bruce fan and am very disappointed in this release.  Do yourself a favor and listed to someone elses disc before you go spend your hard earned money on it.

This was a great idea gone terribly wrong.  The writing is some of the worst I have ever heard.  There is no coherent vision for the album, so it ends up be a confused mess.  It almost seems like there was no producer, just someone keeping score on how the music aligns with the singer's strengths and who get showcased on each song.  I'm sure the score was even, but the album is just a mess.

I really have liked JF's albums over the years, but this one I can not stand ... I know I am going to get slammed with unhelpful reviews, but I am just being honest about this album. There was not one single song on this whole album that stood out for me or was a memorable tune. The music was sounding ok, but then grew stale like i'd heard it a 1000 times before already, and the lyrics, i just found nothing special with that JF touch to them. In my honest opinion this is an entire filler album, nothings sticks out, nothing is memorable, nothing was special, no lyrics stood out, especially with the title making it sound like it was going to be a CCR kind of album... I was honestly falling asleep halfway into this album, i had to keep skipping tracks cause they where so boring.No one can convince me any of these songs found here would be considered a greatest hit of JF's.

Like I've said on my last Review - Sure, Brit has officially lost it: Her Marriage, ended in Divorce, her children may or may not grow up with a Mommy and she shaved her Head.But I Digress; that's Her personal life, and when Reviewing, that Information should *Always* be on the back burner.But this CD if full of Dance-Pop Filler, that No One should want to Listen to. Why, People still buy her music is beyond me!!Is this the worst CD that I've heard all Year?? No, not yet. But it's close. I haven't been a fan of hers really since Toxic and Every time. If it wasn't for the Toxic video, I would have ignored her Senior effort, altogether.She can still out-Dance me any day. But I'd rather have a Celebrity who was the Perfect Bombshell - Blond, at least 5'8, a decent personality, makes for a pleasant singer-songwriter, can Truly Appreciate their Fans that made them what They are today, and a decent Entertainer on a Whole.I Will post Standouts in a Sec. The only one that Grabbed me at first Listen, was the lead Single, Gimme More...Out-of-Sight Tracks:Gimme MoreRadarAnd if for Some Strange Reason, this CD seriously Grows on Me, I'll Be Like, "WTF??", but then I'd Be more than Excited, to up the rating.2.5 stars.

Let's start with the very strong positive: Girls In Their Summer Clothes is one of Bruce Springsteen's best songs ever. My God, the intense longing for the past that it evokes is absolutely palpable. The song is so wistful, so emotionally powerful, it makes you smile and gives you chills of sadness at the same time. Great lyrics, great music, great instrumentation. And the only tune on the album for which the Phil Spector "Wall of Sound" technique is appropriate; after all, Bruce and the band sound like they're channeling the Crystals. (And that's a good thing; no, make that, it's a GREAT thing.) Remarkable.Other than that, there are some songs that are pretty good, songs that most performers would be happy to have written. But, based on past recordings, and based on the kinds of emotional claims he makes, and based on the ambitions for himself that he states...heck, just based on the title of this disc, calling it Magic...Bruce just has to be held to a higher standard. Sorry.Wealth, fame, downright admiration: Bruce Springsteen has earned it all. But if he's going to make as audacious a claim as, "I'll Prove It All Night for your love," He's got to keep on earning it. And that has got to be mighty difficult.It's painful to hear Bruce Springsteen quoting a John Kerry speech as a lyric. Nothing against Kerry, or what he (and apparently Bruce himself) stand for (or against), but let's face it: It's not just unoriginal. It's a cliche. For an artist as formidable as Springsteen, that's just...I don't know...disappointing. Doesn't Bruce have any insights of his own?And referring to the Holy Family as "Jesus, Mary and Joe" is just...cornball.My advice is: Get the record, check it out just to see what one of the great artists is up to. You'll find some worthy songs throughout, maybe even a personal fave. Then put on Girls In Their Summer Clothes and hit "repeat."

I wanted to give this CD 5 stars. The music is excellent. John's writing skills are at the top of his game except for, Long Dark Night and I Can't Take it Anymore.Nothing is more irritating than artists attempting to sound intelligent discussing geopolitics. Now I don't mind commentary and exposition but when performers start blabbering their opinions about geopolitics, they most of the time come off looking quiite stupid.Such is the case with John Fogerty here. Leave the Iraq war out of it. You sing about beating that dead dog of "staying the course". Well John, practice what you preach and quit beating the same o George Bush bashing thing that any simple minded fool can do. I got sick of the whole Clinton bashing thing in the nineties as well. I'm just sick of todays performers taking the easy road of misinformed simple belly aching about individuals when many of us just want to here good solid musical performances with well written material that shows talent.My favorite quote regarding the Dixie Chicks,"Shut up and Sing" applies here.Other than those two boring and irritatingly stupid songs, the album is a 5 stars in my view.

I read many reviews about the terrible mix, and thought to myself that they are probably audiophiles.  I purchased the album, and honestly if I haven't read the other reviews I would have thought that I received a defective CD.  I mean, I own remastered recordings from the 50's that sound better, and I am not kidding either.  The whole thing sounds like it was recorded in a tunnel or just on really cheap equipment.  On most songs Springsteen is unintelligible.  All the instruments play one on top of the others with a computer-like cheap sound.  You find yourself playing with the volume button, more treble, less bass, whatever.... Nothing helps, this thing just sounds BAD.  Now, I am a huge Springsteen fan, and I just cannot understand how nobody around The Boss had the guts to tell him to just not release Magic as is, and take the time to remix it.  Bottom line, if it was just a no-name artist and/or a mediocre album who would really care, but this is Springsteen, and Magic is a great album.  Unfortunately, the Production simply ruined the album and made it hard to enjoy

Could have been SO MUCH MORE!!!!! I downloaded 16 songs that didn't make it on the final cut of the album and in my opinion a lot of those tracks were better then what ended up on the final product. So on my iPod i have 28 songs for the Black Out album. This really could have been a GREAT ALBUM. Despite her personal life she could have channeled some great creative depressing energy into awesome POP music. I was actually in shock that she only co-wrote 1 song while the others were all heavily produced by big name producers. Though she has abandoned Max Martin and moved on she did work a lot with a specific producer from Sweden on this album who i believe she worked with back in her early days. Anyway that producer churned out the tracks Piece of Me, Radar, and Freak show. The song writers drew from her own life experiences and incorporated some of Britney's private life into the lyrics of the songs. When I heard the words in the song and knew it was about her Kevin I looked in the CD booklet and she didn't even write the song. To be honest i was very disappointed in this album. I haven't found 1 track besides Gimme More that has that HOOK to reel you in. And Gimme More had to grow on me it wasn't after the 1st listen that i was hooked. The commercial that promotes this album talks about the HOT new single "Piece of Me" and I just don't get that song, it doesn't do anything for me. This is sorta of a new sound for her, its very electronic, very mechanic and machine like and lacks any sort of feeling. It's all been done before by other artists who aren't so commercial unfortunately Britney will get all the kudos for it as if she invented the sound and in actuality she didn't but she's mainstream. I am sure this will out sell Christina's album but i was just expecting something else and unfortunately that wasn't delivered with Black Out. Here's hoping the new one will be better and she will finally work with Timbaland so he can REVAMP in her image the way he did Nelly Furtado.

I've been a huge fan from the beginning but this album does not impress me at all. With all the pre-release hype I had high hopes. Its just echoes of Tunnnel of Love and Lucky Town. Even the album photos were mundane.

This has some good stuff on it, Radio Nowhere, Living in the Future, Long Walk Home, Girls in their Summer Clothes, but a lot of just OK songs.  It does not have a bad song on it, but not a true classic song either. The bonus track,  Terry's song is good and different.  Compared to Live in Dublin though, this one does not stack up.  THAT is a MASTERPIECE.

I should have read the description better. I didnt realize that they were too lazy to do a whole album. It was like"We dont feel like doing anymore songs what should we do?" Stick in a greatest hits disc and call it a day.I already have the other songs why do I need to pay to get them again.

Much has been made of this "odd couple" pairing, but it's not all that surprising when one considers the gradual mellowing of Robert Plant's work.  Moreover, he has dabbled in folk and country even as far back as his Led Zeppelin days.  (Remember his duet with Fairport Convention's Sandy Denny on "Battle of Evermore"?)  So his weathered tenor is actually a fine fit with Alison Krauss' Appalachian soprano.  It's a successful collaboration, yet I can't help but compare it with Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris' excellent 2006 duet album, "All the Roadrunning", and unfortunately, to me "Raising Sand" comes up a little short.  Whereas the Knopfler/Harris coupling was bright, slick and mostly upbeat, the Plant/Krauss team seems mostly more subdued, and there's only the rare spark of musical energy throughout the album.  "Gone Gone Gone" is about as lively as they get, and it's a winner, a fun and rocking tune which was the advance single for this CD.  Plant stands out on the cover of the rock-n'-roll chestnut "Fortune Teller", too, but other than those two tracks, things are often just a little too mellow.  Not that there's anything really wrong with that, but I just expected a little more rockin', or at least a little more s**t-kicking bluegrass, from this pair.

When did media attention start to equal actual talent? Because if that's how we measure talent these day then yes, Britney Spears, as well as Justin Timberlake for example, are probably the most talented people around. What solid production can do for an album is shown here. I'm not saying that it's a bad album but that it's definitely not Britney's talent that shines here but that of the producers.

Bruce is an amazing legend, and that will never be taken away from him.This album is mind-bogglingly lackluster, even when he tries to be wise and passionate. *Every* track gives the listener the sense that he really didn't want to roll out of bed to make it to the studio.I'm a little bit stunned, because he is the greatest, and I was expecting some "age" to show on this effort, but not an utter lack of committment.And he had to go ahead and call this album "Magic."Aye-yi-yi. It could use some magic. (But I still think he's the best "live" performer on the globe).What were you thinking, Boss?

As a fan of Broadway shows, the music to Wicked is a bit disappointing.  While I thinking "Loathing" is a masterpiece and Menzel does an amazing job on "Devying Gravity", the rest of the CD is rather ho-hum.  Everyone in my family skips the two songs by the wizard (booooorrrring!!!!!).  If you've not seen the show, the CD does not give you many clues into the storyline.  If you were fortunate enough to see the show with the original cast, it's a great memory of their vocal abilities.  Of all the Broadway CDs in our house (almost 50), this one gets played the least.

And in the case of the marvelously talented vocalists Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, both the effort and the result is "NOT MUCH."Have you ever noticed how tight a band sounds after they've been on the road for a few months, polishing their performance and getting live crowd feedback? Well, as the promo video for this album made clear, Plant and Krauss both set aside a few days in their busy schedules to knock off this album, before parting ways again. The music was chosen by someone else (T-Bone Burnett), and they may have had a chance to rehearse it a couple of times before laying down the tracks in the studio (probably separately, I suspect). Despite the superb credentials of the backing musicians, the fact that this is not and never will be a unified group is all too evident.Everything about "Raising Sand" screams "artificial." It's a lightweight confection, concocted in the studio. But fancy engineering can't disguise the fact that neither Krauss nor Plant were really into the music, or even that familiar with it. Their expertise allowed them to fake their way through passably, but the absence of passion and live performance experience with it cannot be disguised.Take a pass on "Raising Sand." Albums like this are the reason why CD sales are crumbling. Somebody is exploiting us here to raise some quick bucks by trading on famous names.

The story behind Paul Potts is remarkable. He has a wonderful singing voice and you can't help but like his humbleness. I'm truly glad the world found Paul.The song mix on this CD is a little weird. It starts with opera, and then there is a rendition of My Way in Italian (I think), followed by Christmas songs. Hmm.Don't get me wrong, Paul Potts sings them all very nicely - it's just a bit of a strange mix.

First of all, it seems pretty lazy to only write a few new songs and cram the rest of the album with old songs.  They couldn't come up with enough new material for a new album? please.The title of the album strikes me as ironic.  The new songs seem to be more mainstream than alot of their older material.I still like the songs, but the band seems to have lost its drive to be creative and not adhere to mainstream sounds.  That's one of the reasons I love them so much, but this album disappointed me.

Finally the new Rock album is out, and I managed to hear it by downloading a copy before it was released, but i can tell you straight off the album was good enough for me to go and buy an official copy of it when it was released.I'm a hard rock fan, and I was hoping Kid would keep it rocking like he has on the last few albums. I was not disappointed at all with the first few tracks.. From Devil Without a Cause to "Rock N Roll Jesus" seems like a weird name, I was wondering about what this would sound like when I heard the name of this as the title of the album, and well, I like it, it has a kind of blues/funk/gospal feel with rock n roll written all over it. Some lyrics i thought where weird at first, but on the second listen this one started to grow on me and has become an overnight favorite."So Hot" - Just about every album KR has come out with, there is a song that I just love from the second it starts. This hard rocking dirty guitar driven song just rocks and f'n rolls. Hearing the opening riff had me moving to the beat and the opening line "you got a body like the devil and you smell like sex" put my mind to rest that Kid Rock had taken a direction into the religious world and the chorus is just so simple, but brilliant, "i dont wanna be your lover, i just wanna BLEEP you like i'm never gonna see you again" this is a song that is going to be a favorite of mine "forever""sugar" like So Hot, this one I liked straight away, with that trademark sound of Kids where it kicks off sounding like a ballad or acoustic number, then the loud drums and guitars kick in Kids awesome Rock vocals... instant favorite for me!So those songs stick out as favorites for me, and this is why i only rate this album 3 songs... "Amen" just does not seem right, I don't know, maybe someone can feel this, but it seems to me it's a filler song, nothing special about the lyrics to me."All Summer Long" combines a couple of familiar riffs, mostly sweet home Alabama, it's a decent song, but not quite catchy enough to keep me listening and expect that it would become part of the live set too often. "Roll On" my first thoughts was "is this the M.A.S.H theme?" I do kind of like this song, but i think it grow on me better after a few more listens, but i do find myself skipping this track a few times, it's a good song, but more of a "have to be in the mood" sort of beat. I just feel this song could have been a bit better with some more time put into it."New Orleans" this is a country song that kind of lags at the start till it gets to the end and speeds up and sounds like the Blues Brothers are doing a country number into rock. I didn't expect to hear a voice like this on the album... something about the song is cool, but also not something you'd crank up in the car or play to loud. The rest of the songs I can't even remember what they where... all i remember is the line "half your age and twice as pretty" or something... maybe I should review this album after I have listened to it a few more times and really seen if anything sticks out more, but so far this is what I've got after having it for about a week.Overall, it's kind of like his last album (self titled) it had it's good songs, it had it's ok songs, it had it's fillers. I would not rate it as good as Cocky where i liked just about every track on it, but this album definitely comes with some killer songs on it that I will never stop listening to.

I've always bought Britney Spears new albums, even though the type of music she makes is usually not the type of music I listen to on a regular basis. I guess I just have an interest in her because we are both from Louisiana. Also her music is usually fun to listen to. Surprisingly, I think this album is one of her best even during the midst of the dramatic hoopla her life has become as of late. The songs are catchy, the lyrics are okay and somewhat gutsy, and the music is upbeat and great for playing in the club or etc. Still, I find some of the songs to be overly produced and lacking any actual music or singing. On a few it just sounds as if someone is making odd noises and Britney is grunting around (Example: "Get Naked"), so, yeah, not all that wonderful at all times. But the songs "Piece of Me," "Radar," "Freakshow," "Hot as Ice" (my favorite), and "Ooh Ooh Baby" are great and catchy songs.

While you can't really go wrong on a greatest hits compilation, I really didn't enjoy the six-song EP.  Some of the songs start out great, but end up being very (as in too) repetitive.  I listened to the EP twice and then put it away.  None of the songs are memorable, none of them are worth listening to more than twice.  None of them are really catchy like the old MB20 songs.  I thought Matchbox Twenty would be putting out more new music in this CD--maybe it's better they didn't, if this is what it's like.  I should have just downloaded the greatest hits I like and skipped purchasing this CD set.

I must have missed it in the linear notes, but where is the songwriting co-credit to George Soros for "Long Dark Night" and "I Can't Take It No More?" -- two fringe Left inspired hate songs that have no lyrical creativity like say a "Fortunate Son" or a "Deja Vu All Over Again." I was hoping to hear the song "Can't Get Nothin' Done" about John's Democratic Party-led Congress with that approval rating of 11 percent. That must be in the soon to be released deluxe edition of "Revival." Politics aside now. Musically, there's really nothing here to get excited about ... we've all heard it before ... "Summer of Love" is a slightly more uptempo version of "In The Garden" from 2004's "Deja Vu"; we hear much of the same lyrical echos and guitar play in these songs as we do in the absolutely wonderful "Blue Moon Swamp" (5 stars!) and the brighter, more bouyant "Deja Vu." Songs to download: "Don't You Wish It Was True" (John's "Imagine"); "Gunslinger" (a more creative slap at George W.; John "Imagine's" Hillary wearing six-shooters); "Creedence Song"; "Broken Down Cowboy" (best song); "River is Waiting" (a little reggae inspired); and "Natural Thing" (which sounds a lot like "Rambunctious Boy").For John's sake, I hope his guy or gal "gunslinger" gets into the White House. That way as Fogerty fans, we might have a better chance of getting an inspired, positive offering such as "Blue Moon Swamp II."

Its been 5 years since Matchbox Twenty has released an album and they put out a greatest hits CD. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think three albums and an EP warrants a "best of" CD. What's really frustrating is that the group recorded 6 new songs for the collection. With just 4 or 5 more songs, they would have completed an album of all original material instead of a pointless greatest hits CD. If you're a fan, then you already have their three albums, so the only reason to buy Exile on Mainstream is for the 6 new songs which you'll have to pay $15 for. If you're a newcomer to the group, I still wouldn't recommend buying it. You're better off starting with "Yourself or Someone Like You" or "Tabitha's Secret," the "lost" Matchbox Twenty album available on Amazon.

Thanks for ruining the new Springsteen record for me Brendan O'Brien. Could you have possibly mixed more tracks into one frequency? Ladies and gentlemen, if you've ever wondered what the E Street band sounded like in a tiny tin box, this is your big chance. Everything is so compressed from the start that by the time it gets to MP3 size it's tough to tell if you're listening to one guitar or 30. The drums sound like they're in another room, the vocals are all but buried half the time and for a band with so many unique personalities, none of them even stand a chance. Nothing is featured ever, it's a muddy mess. I've heard new major label records from baby bands get the brutal radio treatment from O'Brien, but did Bruce really need it at this point in the game? The only song sparred is Terry's Song, but at that point it's too late. Your ears are fried.The hardest part, for me at least, is the general feeling like this is Bruce's strongest collection of songs in a long time, and I can't enjoy them like I would have otherwise. Here's hoping we get a live record from the tour and Rick Rubin is on board for the next one.

These are two supremely talented musicians and they give solid performances on this album, but somehow none of the songs are compelling.  The music is much more sedate than that of Union Station or other bluegrass, and it lacks the edge and passion you would expect from Robert Plant singing the blues.  I admit that my expectations were very high, but even so, this is essentially an album of pleasant background music.

This album conjures up some overwrought moments.  To boot, her voice is starting to travel somewhere very strange.  What used to be magical and emotional has turned into caterwauling.  The title is overstated and promises way more than what is delivered.  I ADORE Annie Lennox, so this is extremely hard for me to swallow.

I realize you will never personally read this.  You undoubtedly now employ a legion of sycophants to perform such tasks for you.  Not so long ago, you were without doubt the most fastidious rock 'n roll performer around.  And your millions of adoring fans loved you for it.  Whether it was a recording session, a concert, a warm up gig in Asbury Park, you were meticulous in your preparation and presentation.  Now comes Magic, your latest CD release.  My, how times have changed.  I must say, I cannot have been listening to the same CD others have reviewed here and awarded 4 or 5 stars.  Maybe the CD I bought was defective.  But probably not, because others have noted the same deficincies I did.  Notably the sound quality. Half the songs are nearly unintelligible.  It sounds as though all instrument tracks and vocals were recorded simultaneously on a cheap cassette recorder you bought at the flea market.  What's that about?  How could you ever allow such a travesty to reach the market?  I read the lyrics in the booklet that accompanied the CD and it appeared you had lots of interesting things to say (as usual).  The problem is, there is no way I could (or anybody else could) possibly decipher your words on half the recordings.  The sound quality on your earliest recordings was vastly superior to this latest effort.  Phil Spector had his "wall  of sound."  I guess we can call this your "sinkhole of sound."  I literally checked all the connections on my CD player, amp, and speakers to see why the sound was so bad.  Then Magic played, and it sounded fine.  So I guess someone intentionally produced your music in this manner.  Why?!?!?  Is this some kind of a cruel joke?  Did you aim to turn out as poor a product as possible, and see if you could still make $10 million off of it?  Is this some jab at Sony over some contractural issue?I realize you have had your problems in the past with the legal and business side of the music industry.  In the CD credits you list more lawyers and business people than musicians!  Is that what this is about?  Has it just become all about the Benjamins?  Well, if that's anywhere near the truth, you've lost the edge, buddy.  If that's what's going on, you need to hang it up, and pass the baton on to somebody else.  I grew up a couple towns away from you.  We're the same age, and lived through many of the same things.  When you sang about Keasby and Highway 9, I was right there with you.  I followed your career with interest since the early '70s.  My cousin and I even met you, and had a beer with you in a little bar in Asbury Park way back when.  You have certainly earned every success you enjoy, and I wish you many more.  But don't let this latest CD be the final chapter in your storied career.  Fix this horrible recording.  Insist it be re-engineered in accordance with current state of the art standards.  Your work deserves nothing less.  Let your fans trade their current CDs for a properly recorded version of your music.  But please,..., don't allow this CD to stand as is and become part of your legacy.  Unless it has become just about the Benjamins.  That will be too bad.  And a big loss to lots of fans.  But we'll get over it.  But I don't think that's how you want to go out.  Well, best wishes to you and yours.  Read back through some of your old lyrics and listen to some of your old recordings, and see which way you're gonna go with this.  I hope you'll do the right thing.  --A Big Fan

2 disc CD set - mainly a 'best of' (CD 2) - the new material is not all that great, and certainly not plentiful (couple of new songs on CD 1). Bottomline, a very lame attempt to sell more records with some mediocre new material by a band that has proven to certainly be capable of much better stuff (based on their past material, which is awesome at best). Hope they'll get their act together (pls, no more Rob Thomas ego/solo projects) and put out better material moving forward.

Don't call it a comeback. Call it a cash-in. Call it expected. Call it absurd. Just don't call it a comeback. When Britney first arrived on the scene nearly a decade ago, she had two main audiences: the prepubescent girl and the creepy old guy. But now Britney's much too raunchy for the younger audience and she's already given the old guys more than a glimpse of pretty much everything imaginable. Those who were fans have largely grown up or grown out of her. So you have to ask yourself, why does this album even exist? "Blackout" is the kind of album that exists for two purposes; to line the wallets of record executives and to boost the ego of Ms. Spears. The point of this album is not to give fans of Britney some new material, but to capitalize on the recent explosion of Britney in the tabloids and celebrity news media. Anyone who can't see that is probably the type of person that would buy this garbage."It's Britney, B****!" That's how she chooses to start the album, and my immediate response is, "I wish it wasn't." "Gimme More" has been a pretty big success for Britney, getting her the highest on the charts that she's been since "Hit Me Baby, One More Time" believe it or not. For what it's worth, it is the strongest song on "Blackout" and probably the only one that should actually exist. The production here is great, as it is through most of the album. Unfortunately for Britney, however, is the fact that the coolest part of the song are the pitch-shifted "mores" that follow her redundant "Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimmes."Despite the production being through the roof, it's also the album's biggest flaw. Britney's voice (which has never been her strong point) doesn't even sound like itself half the time. Every trick that you could possibly come up with to disguise the fact that Britney can't carry a tune is employed here in the hopes that we won't actually notice. According to one critic, "In terms of studio trickery, Paris Hilton's album was practically 'unplugged' compared to this." Never is this more evident than on the song "Radar" where Britney sounds more like a robot than a human being. It's absolutely ridiculous!Also ridiculous is Britney's insistence that she's still America's sweet, little seductress rather than America's punchline. She spends the majority of the album trying to sound sexy and convince us that she's so with such lines as: "If I get on top, you're gonna lose your mind," "Coming back looking delicious, yes I know they wanna kiss me," "I'm just a girl with the ability to drive a man crazy, Make him call me "mama," make him my new baby" "I can feel you on my lips, I can feel you deep inside," or my personal favorite, "Baby I'm just hot for taking, don't you wanna see my body naked?" (Chances are, he probably already has Brit Brit). All this stuff might have been sexy 4 or 5 years ago, but after seeing Britney in every bad scenario possible, these lyrics are a joke! Every time I start to think that she sounds sexy, I have an image of a coked-out bald woman beating the hell out of a car with an umbrella, or a mentally unstable girl who can't keep her kids in her custody for more than a few hours and whose idea of a comeback is casually walking around on a stage lip-syncing in underwear on national television. Granted, Britney doesn't do much on this album besides provide vocals (she's only credited on two songs for co-writing), but you'd think someone who's been in the business as long as she has would have the good sense to know that the majority of the lyrics on "Blackout" are laughable. At one point, Britney's singing "I fall off the edge of my mind..." over and over again. What the hell does this even mean? Does anyone know?In the end, "Blackout" is a misguided, rushed, and ultimately botched attempt at a comeback from an artist that desperately need to take her time making an album that wouldn't be added to her growing list of bad decisions. After all her time in the spotlight, what I wanted to hear most from Britney was something real, something personal that goes deeper than the stupid and overused "bump 'n' grind" lyrics that fill this album. "Blackout" just screams of a rushed job and in the ends, it fails as anything other than a mindless collection of songs with maybe one or two songs that you could dance to in a club. The production is incredible, and if they ever release an instrumental version of "Blackout," I might recommend it to someone. But as it stands, "Blackout" is nothing more than a blip on my radar that I'll forget about tomorrow. And for those who may think I've devoted too much time dwelling on Britney's personal life, take a moment to realize that this album exists for the sole pupose on capitalizing on her escapades, and maybe you'll be able to forgive me.  If the RIAA wonders why people download music illegally these days, look no further than this album. The American public is smart, and we know what good music sounds like. This ain't it! "Blackout" is a collection of mediocre songs, shoveled onto a CD in the hopes of making a quick buck on the tabloid adventures of Britney Spears. No more, no less.Recommended for the mindless, and anyone who wants to give Britney the resources needed to continue her depraved lifestyle.Key Tracks:1. "Gimme More"2. "Hot as Ice"3 out of 10 Stars

(Note: This is a reposted, expanded version of my original review that includes second-day impressions of Songs of Mass Destruction . . .)I've been in awe of La Lennox for more than two decades and have followed the gorgeous unfolding of her career in real time. Against all odds, she's been perfection--whether with Mr. Stewart or solo. Rationally, I knew she'd eventually miss the mark, but I suppose I envisioned an Annie Lennox collection with a few ragged spots; diminished or flickering perfection if you will. What I wasn't prepared for was Songs of Mass Destruction--Annie's Big, Dumb, In-Your-Face American Album. I'm staggered and, frankly, still trying to wrap my head around the claustrophobic production and multi-tracked self-indulgence. Imagine Ann Wilson being produced by Jim Steinman. The voice remains amazing--but in this case, it's like jaw-dropping John Coltrane solos mashed-up with Bat Out of Hell tracks. Yikes. Perhaps Songs of Mass Destruction will sell truck loads, proving me out-of-step with the majority of her admirers. But paradoxically, one of the main reasons I listen to Annie Lennox is because I never willingly listen to discs like this one. Which probably accounts for this queasy feeling that creative directors at major ad agencies with American car accounts are sitting up and taking notice of these songs: Big, over-the-top soundtracks for Escalades hissing down rain-slicked streets. One of the consequences of production that pushes Lennox two inches off the tip of your nose is that the songs themselves are foregrounded as never before--the only possible use of this collection is for Undivided Listening. Doubtless, that was the intent; I can't imagine anyone reading the Sunday New York Times with Mass Destruction playing in the background. But now that Annie has our complete attention--what's being offered?Overall (and of a piece with the aggressive production), it's a painfully obvious collection--47 brick-through-plate-glass-window minutes of grave sincerity and no nuance whatsoever. It's a succession of Big Moments with Big Labels: Art, Politics, Womankind (her term, not mine), Global Problems, et. al. Not forgetting, of course, that Big Title itself: Songs of Mass Destruction. Someone needs to explain this to me. The infamous "weapons of mass destruction" were never found--and that means exactly what for this set of songs? That they're similarly illusory? That, like the namesake weapons, the songs are an excuse for (intellectual) aggression? Unfortunately it smacks of grand gesture--a title chosen simply because it sounded Political, Important and Smart in a Sunday-morning-pundit way.Not surprisingly, then, the songs' biggest collective problem is their sanctimony. Though Lennox has been headed this way for a while, with Mass Destruction, she's joined the twee, sloganeering ranks of Bono and Sting. The Entertainment Tonight substitution of celebrity for expertise is on display here. One of the dodgy  arguments seems to be `I have one of the great singing voices of the past 100 years and I've made very popular synth-pop--so listen to me about Feminism.' But I wonder if the logic works the other way? Based on her impeccable credentials, would we equally humor Gloria Steinem if she said `Hey, I'm a guiding light of Feminism--so listen to my new synth-pop release.' I'm thinking probably not . . . I guess I can't shake an annoying tendency to see distinct and important differences between a pop album and a lecture series. I'm not saying that pop can't be bludgeoned into the form of a lecture; unfortunately, it happens all the time. But be honest--when was the last sunny Saturday morning where you woke up, slotted "Where Have All the Flowers Gone?" and just cranked that sucker up? Yeah--me neither. It's the same reason "Do They Know It's Christmas?" is notably absent from practically every iPod playlist in the world. Pop, meet Lecture Series--Lecture Series, meet Pop.And natch, all this High Seriousness comes with its own equivalent of a PowerPoint presentation: Apparently the deluxe edition of Mass Destruction features track-by-track Lennox Commentary. The mind reels at the need for an adjunct explanation of "I've seen too much/I know too much/I hurt too much." Might I gently suggest that this is not really the same as Ingmar Bergman clearing up an obscure point on a DVD edition of The Seventh Seal?  I'm just saying. Looking back, however, this approach was anticipated by Annie's back-of-jewel-case Cliff Notes that carefully explained the Approved Interpretation of Bare's cover image.Ultimately, Mass Destruction is forcing me to re-examine Lennox's body of work. Essentially, she's been in two long-term artistic collaborations her entire career--Stewart and then Lipson. Has she always been this irritatingly obvious and humorless? Did Stewart and Lipson somehow manage to counterbalance these tendencies? Maybe the big mistake has been hunkering down with Glen Ballard--who's never met a rock anthem he didn't like. Here he functions as an enabler of Annoying Annie, rather than acting as a collaborator.I'll be very interested to see how this recording fares. It seems to fall between a lot of cracks: Too much mainstream California Angst for founding members of her fan base, not rocking enough for the crowd that once bought Heart albums. Too nominally smart for the Middle America and yet too naive for someone like me. From my vantage, Pet Shop Boys' Fundamental is precisely the collection that this release desperately wants to be. That I'm happy to trade Neil Tennant's dusty vocals for the transcendent high notes of La Lennox is evidence that content really is still king--even in pop.Personal to Ms Lennox--Presumably, you still have Stephen Lipson's number in your speed-dial. Please keep it there, and next time, for god's sake, make that call. If you need me, I'll be getting the taste of this thing out my mouth with repeated plays of Bare . . .UPDATE (10-09-07): Songs of Mass Destruction entered UK album charts at #7--the lowest entry for a Lennox solo release to date. "Dark Road" entered the UK singles charts at #58, making it the first solo Lennox single to miss entering the British Top Forty.UPDATE (10-21-07): In Lennox's second week on the UK album charts, Songs of Mass Destruction dropped 11 places to #18. On the US Billboard Top 200 Chart, Songs of Mass Destruction also fell 11 places; from its Week 1 entry at #9 to a Week 2 spot at #21.UPDATE (10-26-07): In its third week on the UK charts, Songs of Mass Destruction falls 21 places to #39. On the US Billboard Top 200 Chart, Songs of Mass Destruction falls 7 places in its third week to #28.UPDATE (11-02-07): Lennox's fourth week on the UK charts shows Songs of Mass Destruction falling an additional 18 slots to #67. On the US Billboard Top 200 Chart, Songs of Mass Destruction falls 15 more slots to #43.

Ironically, in 1974 after seeing a testosterone powered twenty-five year-old Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen at the Harvard Square Theater, music critic Jon Landau wrote, "I saw rock and roll's future and its name is Bruce Springsteen." Ironic because here, 43 years later, Bruce seems determined to stake a new claim as rock and roll's future with a little Springsteen "Magic." Starting with an opening salvo rant of "...this is radio nowhere," Bruce joins the rest of us fellow AARP members in questioning whether  the future of rock and roll includes "rythym." With a wink to Roger Water's Radio KAOS, Bruce speaks from the third "person" silicon view of a satellite searching the radio air waves for "...is anyone alive out there?" Perhaps something our frustrated silicon friend was wondering about Bruce's music for the last few years too?A quick check of the Billboard Hot 100 answers the question; for "Magic" the answer is unfortunately, "no." Nearly 4 weeks after it's release, the re-union of the E-Street Band finds itself non-existent in the top 100 song chart behind the likes of Soulja Boy, Carrie Underwood, and Jay-Z.  Fortunately for Columbia and Sony's pocketbook, "Magic" sits atop the Album charts, but a look at the real test of radio air play shows even forgettable pop trivia like Britney Spears' "Gimme More" making a more substantial claim to the future. So, no, Bruce, there is nobody out there, but I think you really already knew that didn't you?For the most part "Magic" delivers an enjoyable album experience, although producer Brendan O'Brien's "wall of sound" layered-track approach requires a chorus backing vocal approach to Bruce's singing that many will find unpleasant. Fortunately, the inevitable live album will bring us back the gravely rock voice we love. Lyrically and musically "Magic" is more similar to "Tunnel of Love" than "Born in the USA" showing a maturity in Bruce's song-writing (although not musically) and not surprisingly he chooses not to take "Genesis's" approach to reunion by rehashing their hits rather than pushing into new territory. "Livin' in the Future" is Bruce's way of telling us that he isn't going to look back because "...none of this happened yet." Instead he's going into the future even if he has to go there alone. "Girls In Their Summer Clothes" 20 years ago probably would have been a certifiable gold single, it will stick in your mind after only a couple of plays, but in today's market it will probably never get past the adult contemporary top 50. In the course of the second half of the album, Bruce slips away from his planned E-street pop effort and into a personal introspective, and clearly religious perspective. If the message in the cover photo wasn't blatant enough, in "I'll Work For Your Love," "Long Walk Home," and "Devil's Arcade" Bruce returns to his Catholic school upbringing and finds that it's where his heart has been all along. (Something his Hollywood contemporaries would now doubt scorn). In what appears (to me) to be an homage to Mother Theresa in "I'll Work For Your Love," Bruce, in a rather forced iambic lyrical meter, echoes the life's work of Mother by stating that I'll work for what others "...want for free," (I.E.: God's love). A classic Catholic theology resurfaces in the second half of the album for Bruce, as it does to many of us, as we approach, our "Long Walk Home." Finally, it would be remiss not to address Bruce's John Kerry Vietnam inspired who'll be "The Last To Die" for a "mistake". As a firm supporter of the War, you'd think I might find Bruce's latest foray into politics unappealing, but that's not the case here. He is certainly entitled to his opinion, and his way of expressing it is respectful, albeit accompanied by the kind of naivet that surrounds celebrities in America these days. (Basically they think that because they have a microphone they also have something to say). Coincidently the beautiful requiem to long time assistant Terry Magovern who passed away in July, which appears as the hidden track; "When They Built You Brother" (they broke the mold) stands in contrast to Bruce's anti-war rhetoric. Perhaps if Terry, a former navy seal, were still here he could have told his friend Bruce that no soldier ever died for a "mistake," he dies to defend his brothers-in-arms. Bruce, a soldier doesn't go to war to support a political party, he goes, and sometimes doesn't come home, for his country and his brothers, which can never be a "mistake."By the end of "Magic," you'll know that this wasn't a reunion album it's a farewell. Going out on his own terms, Bruce recognizes that the future doesn't include him, or Terry, or Theresa, or us. For those waiting for a return to the "Glory Days," it's going to be a disappointment, but for those who have been listening carefully all along, we always knew that going back was never going to be an option for Bruce Springsteen. Bruce will always be "Livin' In The Future" because it's where he has always lived, even if the pop future is to be left to Britney and Soulja. Bruce knew that. (You don't sell $100 a seat tickets to teenagers you know.) But for those of us with our AARP discount who can afford a hundred bucks plus for obstructed view seating we'll be there with him for the "Long Walk Home" because, like your friend Terry, when they built you Bruce, they broke the mold.

I listened to the album on MSN the other day (and sat through the entire thing without fast-forwarding) and I gotta say ~ It's  an album of heavily-processed 'TALKING' (..must have missed the singing bit) over a number of very similar 'boop/bleep beats'. The whole thing. That's it.  To each their own I guess..  But I personally found the whole thing silly and boring. Not even worth an 'illegal download'.. let alone actually paying something. (May as well throw my money in a dog's mouth if I was going to do stuff like that..)  If this is supposed to be her 'Best Yet!' (an often used phrase here)  ..I'd really hate to experience what the 'less than best' involved.Really people, If this is all it takes to entertain you these days?..  I recommend getting yourself a few electronic gizmos and a digi recorder.  That ought to REALLY give you a blast  ..and you might very well make a few BETTER albums than this one along the way.

Five years ago, who would have thought that la Spears would turn out to be the mess that she is today?  With her freakish antics with K-Fed, her children, her hair and the press, this frequent and habitual user of drugs needed one helluva album to redeem her career.  She doesn't pull through, unfortunately.  The final result is a mess of an album ("Blackout," how appropriate is that???) with no continuity or originality whatsoever.  She's become the Michael Jackson of her generation--a bright and shining star that fizzled out much too soon.

Bruce, I love ya but after listening to the first four tracks of Magic my response is a resounding "What he say?". The sound was so muffled I could not make out the lyrics. I thought I had purchased a bad bootleg. Target can keep my $14 just promise me to remix it. Fast. I have a 1978 Un-Concert on cassette that has better sound definition. I know there is a great album in there somewhere. Please remaster. This CD could have been your best since Tunnel of Love.

The Sample Bytes on the Webpage sounded Great.When I received the CD, I was very disappointed. He sounded Like an amateur...There was no depth or substance in his voice.Maybe it was the choice of songs......Most of the songs were recorded by another English Artist (Russell Watson)and Mr. Potts cannot compareto the feelings Mr. Watson puts in his version of the songs.....Take "Caruso" and "Nella Fantasia" Mr. Potts sounded as I said like an amateur and had no training....I wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone.....

Despite being a ratings juggernaut, American Idol has failed to launch that many careers after the karaokers have to start singing there own music. In six seasons only Kelly Clarkson has been able to produce two hit albums.Hoping to join her in the former karaoker two hit club is Carrie Underwood, whose first album Some Hearts recently overtook Clarkson's Breakaway as the highest selling post-karaoke album ever. And considering CMT recently devoted six straight hours of playing her new video for So Small, a second hit album is on the way.Where the first album seemed to alternate between country and pop songs, the follow up Carnival Ride is a strictly honky-tonk affair. That is not a good thing because that means some of the country songs that you listen to and feel your IQ drop sneak onto the album in the form of filler. This no more evident than on The More Men I Meet where Carrie pontificates why the only male for her is one walks on all four and waves his tail. The worst of all though is when Carrie gets back to her karaoke roots with a cover of I Told You So by Randy Travis which would have been best left on the cutting room floor.Then some of the better songs are just rehashes from the first album. So Small could have been called Jesus Take the Wheel part II with its religious themes. And if So Small is a sequel, then Last Name might very well be a prequel to Before He Cheats telling a tale of how the two met before the dude began to stray. But the problem with that Before He Cheats without the woman scorned angle just isn't as entertaining with silly lines like, "It started out , `hey cutie where ya from?' and turned into `oh no what have I've done?'" Maybe you should go back to singing Shania Karaoke.That is not to say the album is completely lost, Carnival Ride starts off with banjo heavy Flat on the Floor, a ballroom brawler that is good as the Dixie Chicks at their angriest which includes the Led Zeppelin like, "Baby, baby, baby" line. Then there is the emotional roller coaster of Just a Dream seen through the eyes of a military wife at her husband's funeral. And the powerful I Know You Won't is the leading candidate of songs that the next batch of karaoker will fight over during Carrie Underwood night.The highlight of the album though is the album closer Wheel of the World which not surprisingly is the least country song on the album. The song is a better written, lyrically and musically, version of So Small. Hopefully this is the direction Underwood takes for the third album or her third album may crash and burn like Clarkson's recent release.

Annie Lennox is a fantastic performer, probably the best female performer from the 80s! This CD has way too many slow slongs and not enough electro-pop. I gave a song by song review on the discussion board. Because I am a huge Annie Lennox fan I gave the songs way better scores, but to the casual listener he or she might be bored with this cd.

So I've listened to the tracks on this CD and I was thoroughly unimpressed.  They all sounded exactly the same.  There was no tempo variances, no drum or other instrument variances.  It sounded like the same track repeated over and over.  It was just awful and boring beyond belief.  Yuck.

I give Dave Grohl heaps of credit.  The man who once played drums behind the greatest songwriter of a generation set his sights on greater ambitions and emerged victorious atop the modern rock pantheon.  Album releases are always consistent: the content within never fails to sell the notion of the redemptive powers of rock and roll.  Yet for all of his songwriting chops, I feared this new Foo Fighters album might exhibit Grohl as his own worst enemy, a man who, in a recent interview (I believe it was Spin), conceded that his comfort zone had always resided near heavy melodic rock. "Echoes, Silence, Patience, & Grace" is not short on the gratuitous melodic rockers, but it does demonstrate a more varied and vulnerable approach to the Foo formula in a manner far less contrived than 2005's "In Your Honor."  Four out of the first five tracks are classic howlers, with Grohl purging his emotions through snarled vocals amidst a backdrop of thunderous drumming and crushing distortion.  See "Let It Die" or "Erase/Replace" to get a picture.  Exploring more subdued textures and atmospheres, the Foos give us tracks like "Stranger Things Have Happened" "The Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners," the latter of which features the deft guitar work of Kaki King.  Closing things out on a highly introspective note, we are given the song "Home."  Allegedly a songwriting milestone for Grohl, the tune is also the most likely musical connection to the album title. After 12 years of pursuing the "if it ain't broke..." formula, it's a refreshing to see America's most reliable rock and roll outfit pushing themselves, even if just a little bit.  Studio release #7 should be spectacular.

There's no denying her truly impressive singing voice and she has a great stage presence performing live.  But it has to said this is a CD of mostly slow-beat tracks about fairly dark, depressing themes. Not a bad CD at all, but I'm not often in a mood to hear these sorts of tracks. Where is the ironic humor many of us loved from her music from the 80's?

I have never liked this girl's voice. She is a screamer. The girl has no idea how to make a subtle statement. I know that Martina and Yearwood both have that screaming ability, but it works for them. They seem to have better control of their voice. Underwood's voice sounds tired, and she just never quite hits those notes. I find myself straining along with her when I hear her try to hit that high note. On several numbers she shows possibility, but always overkills the song with too much screaming, and the production on this album is contemporary country ad nauseam.

The new album from John "Clearwater" Fogerty isn't all that bad, but it's not that good either. The hype surrounding this Creedence like album really sucked me in, but when all is said and done, there might have been enough good material here to release a four song EP but not a whole album. I really wish Fogerty would make up with his old CCR buddies, because this backing band on "Revival" does not do him justice, unlike the guys that once backed him between 1968-1972. If you must get this album prepare for a Rutles like tribute to Creedence Clearwater Revival, but failing to be as entertaining this time around.

At face value, 'Raising Sand' could be one of the more unusual pairings in recent musical history. Not as odd as say, Tom Waits & Crystal Gayle (seriously - you must pick up 'One from the Heart' soundtrack!). This is more along the lines of Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris.Like the latter grouping, Plant & Krauss don't really perform that many duets. Sometimes I swear they don't even appear on each others songs. To be fair - there is nothing on the external (or internal for that matter) packaging that says they do - it is just implied.When they do perform duets (or at least harmonize more), it usually works. I really enjoy "Rich Woman", "Please Read the Letter" and "Gone Gone Gone". It would have been nice to see more of it.There are duet missteps: "Killing the Blues" for instance. It seems Alison & Robert have drained the entire life out of this cover. If you want to hear a good take on it - check out Shawn Colvin's version from her 'Cover Girl' disk from 15 years back or so. I cannot say I have ever been a big fan of Robert Plant. I was the odd man out in high school - preferring Nick Lowe or the Clash to Led Zeppelin. Plant doesn't seem to stretch that much on this outing - but what do I know when it comes to this. He's had a few different lives since Zeppelin, so did not start out as reigned in.Krauss however finally gets to break free from the Union Station mold which has grown a little stagnant as of late. Technically the band is great, but are caught in a formulatic rut. "Sister Rosetta Goes Before Us" has influences of Greek music and she take the masculine lead on Mike Campbell's (from Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers) "Let Your Loss Be Your Lesson".But the most mesmerizing and possibly annoying thing about the record are actually one in the same - Krauss' take on Waits' "Trampled Rose". I cannot quite explain it, but the continuous climb to and fall from the high note is a major focal point of interest to me.For good or bad, she's slightly out of her element and I find it welcoming. She stretches her boundaries and that can only help her work with Union Station down the line.Overall, I say it is an ok disk, but nothing more than that. I will not go as far as to say it is a wasted opportunity but perhaps a missed one - as there was much more they could have done with it. When their voices do blend, it proves to be an interesting dynamic.

The sound of this CD makes my ears bleed. How can anyone with taste actually think this is "the greatest "? Led Zepplin tickets for the London gig are sold out, because they are "Led Zepplin" not because Robert Plant can sing anything with anyone. As for Alison Krauss,what is she thinking?!Who ever talked these two singers into this hype must be able to sell the idea of a freezer to an eskimo because , as wonderful as these two are on their own, together they sound like a "Sesame Street" kids musical. UGH

Bubble gum pop gone stale.Most tracks have Britney's voice morphed (which might be a good thing) so it doesn't even sound like her half the time.There really are a couple of good, quality tracks on 'Blackout', but most of the CD is just a bunch of throw away garbage.I think it's time for a more mature sounding Britney, because I certainly feel that she has the talent to make something special.

Damn son, listen to that rock & roll!. Radio Nowhere, that's the Boss bitching about how crappy radio is...or is it a veiled reference to bigger issues? Ya never know with the Boss these days. Damn, that song sounds just like the one on Born To Run...hey the sax solo sounds the same too! You have to listen real careful because that Pearl Jam producer mixes the E-Streeters way in the back, especially those troublsome drums...never did like how old Max's drums rolled like thunder on those early records...I kind of like them all muffled and such. Hey, that song has a damn harpsichord on it...sounds like that old Pretty Ballerina song by the Left or Right Banke or something. That one sounds like the Boss channeled some Brian Wilson or something...those girls in their summer clothes...wait isn't Brucey like pushing 60? Creepy. Hey, I think these songs are talking about the war...yup that war over in the Mid East has gone south...I wasn't sure though until the Boss told me so using those metaphors and all. I'm glad he's back playin' that pure rock again, yeah, I know there's some fiddles on this record too, but Brendan makes 'em sound so grundgy don't he? Hey, there's a hidden track here...and it's all heartfelt and honest...and well, touching too...why the hell did he have to ruin a perfectly good drive through nostalgiaville with such emotion? Run out an get this one quick fellers before the Boss starts channeling Woody or Bobby again and poor Max is back pounding the skins on late night.

I have admired Ms. Lennox from her days with Eurythmics and throughout her solo career. Yet it seems that her efforts in this and her previous album have lost some of the initial steam that made her first two solo productions so powerful.I couldn't help but feel a "deja vu" type feel when I listened through the album the first time... and the second one... and every single time. It reminded me too much of classic Annie, which could be a good thing. But artists of her stature (I am thinking of Peter Gabriel when I say this) need to find ways to reinvent themselves to escape the risk of becoming classics.As much as I love Annie Lennox, I didn't find in this album what I was hoping for.

After waiting a long time for new tunes from this performer, we are greatly disappointed with the CD.  Only two or three songs are worthy of the old sound.  The lyrics to the political songs are unpleasant, uninteresting and uninformed. The two tracts in particular, "Long Dark Night", a cheap attempt at a political satire, shows no musical talent. "I Can't Take It No More" is what we felt after hearing the first verse. The only good song is "Don't You Wish It Were True." If we had heard the entire CD first, we would not have bought it at all. Sorry, John.

First: I'm not a fan, but given the hype surrounding the release of this CD, I had to listen to it and give it an honest chance. I thought...MAYBE, she'll reinvent herself. Other artists before her have done the same - after a scandal, they'll turn around and release something that no one expects, something that truly showcases their talent, and blow everyone away.Not so in this case: Britney is simply a pawn in the game, and the game is "Britney". Any "artist" that takes her or himself too seriously runs the risk of parody, and the 2nd song on this disc, "Piece of Me" proves that point in spades. "I'm miss lifestyles of the rich and famousI'm miss Oh my God that Britney's shameless.....get in line with the paparazzi that's flippin' me off"...When an artist's personal life is under the microscope, it can be written about in ways that can astound. "Layla" by Eric Clapton - about his affair with his best friend George Harrison's wife - yet, he doesn't feel the need to namedrop himself.The whole album "Rumors" by Fleetwood Mac - about the 2 divorces going on in the band, the affairs, the drugs, all the problems they were going through - yet again, no names were called out.Simply singing about onesself in the first person is uninspired, and a sign that they take themselves WAY too seriously.That being said, both the lyrics and music on this CD feels like a step backwards. The other lyrics reek with the banality of today's brand of pop: cheap, easy couplets thrown together with no sense of direction. (Note: using the word "motherfu**er" today doesn't shock, doesn't offend - if anything, it sounds like one is trying TOO hard to shock & offend.)Songs about partying, sex, and of course, "no one understands me". Same old same old. The music, while being very, very well produced, is repetitive (not in a good way, mind you) and bland. Cookie cutter beats and uninspired solos exactly where they are expected.I truly wish Ms. Spears had done something off-the-wall - something like a slower release (Norah Jones or Fiona Apple, for example) - that would have blown minds...but I realize that she would alienate the masses of sheep that buy this sort of product - we can't have that, can we? Not lucrative enough. Forget respect, this product is about the $$$, and don't let anyone tell you different. I think Britney has a decent voice, and that she does indeed have talent - but it's certainly not put to use here. The result is a muddledaffair, void of any true creativity, and reeking of banality.The first star is for effort, and for the single, "Gimmie More". It's not half bad for a dance track, but the track itself has no real sustenance. Maybe that's not what the producers were going for, but at this stage in her career, it's make or break. The second star is for the one  really good song here, "Hot as Ice". It a good dance track with a very catchy melody, but it reminds me of Parliment meets Cameo (and that's not a bad thing). If the rest of the electropop on this CD was of the caliber of this track, it would have been a more successful venture. Sadly, this is the sole true stand-out. Sure, this CD will sell like hotcakes for a week or two, then it will drop off the charts, and be forgotten.  Knowing this is probably her last #1 is the fault of both her producers and herself...she had the chance for the comeback, and with "Blackout", she blew it.

Unfortunately for the current future of mankind, we humans (and particularly, we Americans) find ourselves in a particularly regressive state.  We would rather watch a plethora of reality shows than CNN, we want superficial movies with talentless-to-only-somewhat-talented actors and actresses, we seem to find it perfectly acceptable that athletes and glossy Hollywood types get paid millions per year while teachers and scientists are often struggling to get by, and we mindlessly accept pretty-packaged musical atrocities as art.  Whomever first described the musical fare in the vein of Britney Spears as "sugary" was absolutely correct.  To the passive listener, Britney's music tastes good going down, but is ultimately not only of no value to the body, it is actually harmful.From her first album until now, Britney has been the poster child for all the popular music cash cows that the greedy record executives anxiously sign to their labels.  The philosophy is simple:  make as much money possible by any means necessary.  To do this, songwriters and producers are brought in to provide serious support to the usually barely-talented (if at all) "artist".  The most financially-rewarding demographic has demonstrated in their buying habits that they don't want lyrics that make them have to think, they like sexual content (whether explicit or implicit), and they like catchy melodies and harmonies.  Thus, the artist doesn't need to have even decent vocal ability.  What is commonly referred to as "auto-tune" will make sure no off-puttingly wrong notes are hit, songwriters will write tepid lyrics (usually representative of immature modes of thinking), and producers will create the vocal melodies and accompaniment (or what is simply referred to as "beats" in the popular culture) that are easy to remember (and, oftentimes, easy to dance to).  All of this serves to hook the *passive* listener on the music, which can result in any combination of album, ticket, perfume/cologne, toy, and clothing line sales.Most music reviewers are proving that they really have no authority to be ranking albums, as they seem to be unable to tell just how terrible Britney's music is.  I have already seen some far too optimistic reviews given to this album by critics, while the few truly artistically-impressive albums coming out are getting reviews that are just blatantly insulting when compared to those of "artists" like Britney.  What seems to be impressing the critics is the production on the album.  Sadly, the production is often credited to the performer when it should really be credited to the producers.  Britney has certainly acquired an astonishing amount of money by now, and she brought in "it" producers who be able to carry her album for her.  However, despite the constant criticism of her terrible vocal abilities (and probably terrible aural skills, although we can't be sure of that, since she continues to lip synch in her performances), Britney has demonstrated her infamous ignorance yet again and has STILL hasn't pursued serious vocal training to improve the quality of her singing.  On top of that, her lyrics are still terribly lacking in creativity, uninspiring, and simply immature (and sadly, she had to pay people to write them for her because hers would be even worse).Based on the other new releases for this week that I have seen, as well as the ridiculous amount of news coverage this album is getting (due to Britney's other parts of her life that she is also insanely ineffective at managing), I expect this album to debut at #1 on the Billboard album sales chart next week.  However, that doesn't mean that my message will have been for nothing if I can convince even one person who is thinking about buying this album from doing so.  We human beings are supposed to be progressive thinkers, as we are the most cognitively-advanced creatures on this planet.  Music is art, and we deserve better than this as our art.  We deserve for high-quality music to once again be the "popular music" of our culture.  We have the power to decide what the record labels feed us, and one way to do that is to refuse to give them our money when they try to feed us this "sugary" music.  We have to regain control.

I've been a Fogerty fan for over 35 years...so it pains me to say that this CD is just plain disappointing.  There are a couple of catchy tunes...but those get lost amidst the anti-conservative vitriolic lyrics in several of the tunes.  Subtle questioning of the status quo which leaves much to the listener's imagination is O.K....even expected by an anti-establishment guy like Fogerty.  But flat out using the President and Vice-President's names in hate filled tunes is just unacceptable.  Sorry John...but I think you need to get back to singing about the swamps and bayous.....'cause that's what the majority of us like.  As a consumer...if you're a far left leaning type with an ear for bluesy, grass-roots type rock, then check this album out.  If you are anywhere to the right of being a far left extremist....pass on this one because the music isn't enough to overcome the rhetoric!

Actually, I'd give it no stars.  But Amazon is too charitable. Couldn't the house have fallen on the Wicked Witch in the first scene.  "Wicked" is disappointing.  It's as if the pyrotechnics, a la "Starlight Express," can make up for the lack of songwriting and original score.  It's derivative. It's laughable in non-comedic sense.  Its an incredible money machine for some reason.  At least I feel for the actors who deserve the continuing paychecks. But I need a few magic monkies to fly in and pickup some of the teenies in the audience who always manage to use their cells they are so bored.  Wave your magic wand!  Make it all disappear. "Mommie, Mommie, rescue me."  "Sorry, babe, Glendora told you to turn off your cells!."

I'm one of those people who loved Matchbox Twenty, and when Rob Thomas broke off to do solo-pop, I just couldn't listen to him anymore. Thus, I was quite excited for a new Matchbox album...six new tracks is more than enough to make me happy, provided they are solid songs. Unfortunately, the only one that approaches the standards set for themselves years ago is "These Hard Times". The new songs are too poppy, with too much focus on the not-so-worthy hooks. The musical depth and solid song structuring is just not there anymore. Even the old "pop" singles had so much going for them that is missing from the new songs. The new work is missing it's blues influence, the great guitar drives, vocal emotion...I could go on.That's not to say it's a disaster...Rob Thomas can still sing, and he can still write songs. The new stuff isn't bad, it just doesn't live up; it feels too influenced by his transfer over to the pop world. I would say that if you like Rob Thomas and his solo work, you will like Matchbox Twenty's new release. If you are like me, and you stopped paying attention to Rob once he left Matchbox...then the release is likely to disappoint.

Other review, and national review I read are correct - dump this producer - sounds like it was recorded through a pillow-case. Listen to Darkness, Born to Run, The River albums - distinct instruments, each enjoyable and identifiable,........then listen to this!! The entire musical production sounds completely indistinct and mushed together. Where's the saxophone? Even the vocals are muffled and muted. Too bad - just not enjoyable. Listen to the first 15 seconds of any of these songs - Badlands, Something in the Night, The Promised Land, Darkness, 10th Avenue Freeze-out, Jungleland, The Price You Pay, Fade Away, The River, ..... gosh, I could go on and on - the sax, the harmonica, Bruce's voice, the bass drum,.....Where's the soul wrenching moan of Something in the Night? The emotional reasonance of She's the One? What the heck happened here? Recordings from 20 and 30 years ago sound clearer and more distinct. I guess I'll keep listening to the classics on my MP3 player. This was very disappointing - fire the producer - get rid of the pillow cases - bring back the clarity and instrumental distinctiveness.

It's been five years since "More Than You Think You Are" and this is what we get? Very disappointing. I didn't realize this release was a greatest hits effort until I got to Best Buy to pick it up. Very disheartening to only see six new tunes - which I find average at best. These new songs sound more like Rob Thomas solo tunes than MB20 anthems. I thought the band hit their stride after MTYTYA. That was their most complete and mature body of work. I was expecting them to build on that. Not rush six new songs to complete some greatest hits package. And as for the greatest hits... not a fan. No offense, but I never need to hear "Push" or "3AM" again. Overplayed and killed by radio. All they did here was regurgitate the songs radio killed. A greatest hits album should include what truly were some of the band's better songs. Not what the A&R idiots told them to release. Where's "Downfall" or "Hand Me Down" of the last CD? What about "Rest Stop" or "The Burn"? How about some more classic live tunes, acoustic versions of songs, B-sides or cover tunes? To date, I still don't have a quality version of MB20's rendition of "Time After Time". Those who buy the CD, score from Best Buy for the two bonus live tracks "Remedy" by the Black Crowes and "Modern Love" by David Bowie. Those two covers almost make the CD worth the $12 I plunked down. Almost.Here's hoping that the six new tunes grow on me, but initially they lack the same oomph as when I heard "Disease", "Bent" or "Long Day" for the first time - the respective first singles off all three studio releases.MB20 is one of the better bands of the 90s and this compilation doesn't do them justice. I have a better 'greatest hits' playlist on my iPod.

T Bone, Plant & Krauss are excellent as usual, but it's not anybody's best work and the album doesn't flex each others strengths.  Instead it challenges the artists to step outside their comfort zone to develop something new. The music is complimentary of both vocalists, and together they create a splendid canvas of sound.  What isn't so great is the recording. Poor sound engineering ruins this album. If you're listening with a cheep sound system, you may never hear the plethora of issues.  For the rest of us, we must chalk it up as yet another failure of the media industry to produce quality music. It's a shame so many people worked so hard to create a masterpiece that only excels in concept, not reality.  The reality is that the poor quality of engineering is too annoying to ignore and killed what could have been a classic album.

I have been a hard core Foo fan since the beginning and I have to say that this album was a disappointment.  I was looking forward to some non-skin and bones stuff, but it seems that Dave wants to be a singer and not so much a rocker.  I would buy it again and it has some hard rockin tracks, but be prepared for the married with children Grohl sound too.

I just skimmed through this album the other night, borrowed it from my friend.The first thing I wondered is how many of these guitar riffs are complete rip-offs from rock classics?I noted at least 3 songs where the main guitar riff sounds like a slightly altered version of an old rock song. Other than that, this album has a pasteurized corporate sound to it. Kid Rocks adolescent boasting and posturing gets tiresome. The songs that are non ripoffs are the weaker ones on the album, showing the amount of creativity, originality, and talent put into this album- not much.The only thing I will give Kid Crock credit for is he tends to put on a good live show, but that cant cover for mediocre(at best), uninspired music. It's a sad reflection on our culture when throwaway albums like this are lauded as being excellent.

I've always really liked Annie Lennox, despite thinking she's consistently hit-or-miss (except for the excellent "Diva").  But she's outdone herself this time; this is an over-produced, unimpressive collection that sounds like a recycling of the worst songs of her career.  There are a few decent tracks, but nothing new or exciting, and most of the songs are boring at best.  And at their worst...well, the chorus of "Ghosts In My Machine" might be the most gratingly awful thing I've heard in music all year.  And Annie's usual vocal exercise, while expected, is taken to such heights here that it becomes charicature:  "Woo!" and "Yeah Yeah!" abound throughout the whole album.  (And she's even added a new classic to her repertoire:  "Brrrrrr bop!")  I've been listening to this album, trying to get it to grow on me, but when it comes time to spring-clean the old iPod, this album will be the first to go.  Sorry Annie...I'm a fan, believe it or not, but it might be time to hang up your funky hat and call it a day.

I agree with others about the sound quality here. It's like Bruce went for some sort of retro "Wall of Sound", only louder. Whatever, the great band sounds like a mess. As for the songs, I'd say this is a pretty unremarkable album. I can't think of one on here that I'll be screaming for him to sing when I see him live in a couple of weeks. And in a couple years, I won't remember any of them. There's nothing fresh about the music or the lyrics. Mabe Girls in Summer Clothes and Radio Nowhere, but that's a reach. None will make a "Best of" list.

I was excited when I heard this 2 disc set was coming out initially. I knew there would only be 6 new songs. I accepted that. I knew it would be packaged with a greatest hits disc. I accepted that as well. Then when I saw what was on the greatest his disc, It was my first bout with disappointment. All of the "have to" songs are there. I understand that. But there are so many other songs that should have been included. At least 4 or 5 more songs. But that's no biggie. I have all the other albums anyway. So I got by that. I heard the first single "How Far We've Come". I thought it was "ok". So I figured to myself that the other 5 would be even better. I couldn't have been more wrong. I couldn't help but feel that Rob Thomas and company are holding back. These songs don't really sound like the MB20 I have grown to love over the years. Yeah, bands need to try something different sometimes. But it didn't work in this case in my eyes. I couldn't help but get the feeling that these songs were written in like, a week or something. Like the guys were holding back and putting something out simply because they knew the name would sell. Seems like Rob may be trying to turn Matchbox 20 into something new...while turning his solo stuff into what Matchbox 20 used to be since a lot of it sounded like Matchbox stuff. I hope this isn't the last we hear of the guys from Matchbox 20. This would be such a disappointing way to go out.

The voice I love is there.  The phrasing still moves me.  The material is tiresome.Stephen King throws some stinkers between great works.  These are stories that must be told before we get to the good stuff.  Ms. Lennox does the same thing on this album.  Perhaps she works these through her system before delivering a gem.

I really enjoyed Carrie's first album, though I'm more a pop fan than country.  "Before He Cheats" was hot, and I could listen to "Wasted" over and over.  I even liked "Jesus Take the Wheel" even though I don't like country ballads.  And that's my main problem with this album.  NINE of the thirteen tracks on this album were ballads.  And they were boring, cliche ballads at that.  Carrie has a clear, beautiful voice that shines on fast and mid-tempo tracks.  Unfortunately, there is only one truly fast song on this, "Flat on the Floor."  There are couple of other okay songs, but nothing worth listening to repeatedly.I read an interview where she said she was miffed that people didn't consider the first album country.  I can only guess she wanted everyone to be positive this one was country, and did her best to out-Twang "Some Hearts."  I think she shot herself in the foot doing so - you can still be true to country and have cross-over appeal.  Look at Martina McBride, Shania Twain or even Reba - no one doubts they are country, but they still attract non-country fans to their music.  Fans of traditional country will probably love this album; I recommend anyone else give it a listen first.  I wish I had listened to this it before buying.  I'll never buy another of her albums without doing so.

I agree with the review that says this album is disappointing. Carrie has learned some new vocal tricks which is excellent, but some are repeated. For example, she goes into the high-pitched almost falsetto voice a lot on this album. It's a nice trick but overused. A few of the songs are good, but I felt like I was wondering what the 2nd hit will be... none of the songs are stunning. So Small is a great song. Flat on the Floor is pretty good as well and I Know You Won't is interesting. But a song with a lyric like "the more boys I meet, the more I like my dog" is just childish. Also, the 'Last Name' song seems to want to play off of Before He Cheats, but it's just lame. The lyrics are overly trite on this album. It's worth a listen and I'll probably put it on my iPod, but it's not spectacular. It doesn't stand out.

Is it me, or does anyone remember when Broadway musicals used to actually have songs in them? You know, the kind you walked out of the theater singing? After seeing the film version of Phantom of the Opera and seeing this show last night at the Pantages, I seriously wonder if any Broadway writers remember how to write a song. Where are the "Maria"s? The "When you're a jet"s? The "Sound of Music"s? Nowadays they just crank out verbose, meandering showcase numbers for the leads to just belt away...and nothing more. I'd give my right nut for another Grease, another Tommy, another Rocky Horror Show, Hair, Camelot or man of La Mancha. I know people want to see a musical about the Wicked Witch of the West - I did - but let's call a spade a spade and admit these songs go nowhere (and trust me, I know of what I'm talking about, being a songwriter and musician for many years). Neat premise. No songs.

I work as an intern at Jive records and she came in for a few days, they recorded/dubbed her voice and that was it. The sound, the beats, everything was done out of her hands. To me that's where the music is at, in the beats a composition of the songs. Right? Britney is a name, and her name sells. I heard someone say that there. I believe it's true too. Reguardless if this album is good or bad it will sell either way. Everyone who made this record or promotes it will make money. It's a win, win situation. It's a shame that this happens in a world where real artists have to work for what they get and appreciate it. I do like the business for the most part though. Good with the bad.

I love them both.  But this collaboration is an example of why 10 brilliantly talented musicians in a room, without a coherent vision for the album, doth not a good album make.The band is basically a jug band.  They play with a loose "boys from the hills" flavor."  They play great, but the songs simply don't go together.  You've got hints of bluegrass, hints of Led Zeppelin, hints of Tommy James and The Shondells, Buddy Holly, ... in fact, there are hints of a lot of influences in there.But this makes the collection come off sounding too much like a random bunch of nothing.  The recording quality is the pits.  The bass and the kick drum are way too heavy in the mix, to the point that they cloud up everything.  Krauss (on all the other albums I have of hers) is usually close-miked with a beautiful Neumann capsule unit that gives her the beautiful sound of expensive crystal and fresh air.  Here, she is simply reduced to midrange mud.Robert Plant sounds like his heart really isn't in ANY of these songs.  He sounds like he's "happily going along because he's got nothing better to do" when he harmonizes.  When he is the lead, he sounds like he'd rather be singing something else.  Great voice, expert mechanical skill, but no soul.Krauss's previous effort included one duet with John Waite (a remake of his "Missing You").  That song was radically different from everything else on that album, but it was only one song.  It's okay to have an "out there" track in the mix, and it was beautifully done.  But this album is just one random redirection after another.  And none of them are very good songs.  One wonders where they even came up with this lackluster set list.If you were waiting for an explosion from the fusion of the great Led Zeppelin singer and the greatest female vocalist on the planet, you'll be disappointed.It's amazing.  They sing great.  The band plays great.  The album stinks.

Die hard fans of the Beathes will be the ones interested on this movie. But most Beatles fans never find out anything wrong with their work. Well, if we are honest, we will notice that Lennon's music sometimes sucks (Revolution #9) and that most of their records are not perfect (come on, you hate those experiments by George with Indian music).<p>In other words, when the Beatles are good, they are excellent (95% of the time), but when they are bad, it is ugly (5%).<p>I think Help!' falls in the five percent. The movie is about cult members and scientists trying to get a ring out of Ringo's finger. You think this will go for about 10 minutes, but too late you find out that's all what the movie is about.<p>I give three stars to the movie only because of the music. However, the songs are pushed within the film, as they are not related to the plot. At one moment, they are playing with snow while singing Ticket to Ride. This comes out of nowhere.<p>Anyway, the movie is not good, but it is an opportunity to see the Beatles, together, and in witty behavior. Now, that is something that a fan will appreciate, even in a stupid movie as this one.

As a huge Springsteen fan, I've been very excited to hear "Magic", especially considering the great advance buzz the CD has received in the press.  Reviews have called it a return to the glory days, and I've heard several comparisons to "The River".Sorry, but not even close.  Anyone comparing this to "The River" needs to go back and re-listen to tracks like "The Ties That Bind", "Jackson Cage", and "Two Hearts".  Those were propulsive rock tracks that swept up the listener in the amazing energy of Bruce and the band .  Sadly, there's nothing on this new CD that lives up to those tracks.  "Long Walk Home" probably comes the closest. It's a moving and slowly-building anthem with a memorable chorus and some lovely lyrics (it reminds me a little of "Land and Hope and Dreams", although lyrically LOHAD is a much better song).  The rest of the songs are mainly mediocre pop songs that could be outtakes from "Human Touch".  I think he's going for a sort of Beach-Boys-meets-the-Jersey-Shore sound that doesn't really work in my opinion.  A song like "Girls in Their Summer Clothes" definitely has a "Pet Sounds" feel to it.  And while it's a catchy pop song, it's certainly no great addition to the Springsteen catalog.I am still glad to see this new release, as anything that gets Bruce and the band back out on tour is ok by me.  But I would not call "Magic" a triumph or a return to the rockin glory days of the E Street Band.  Bruce is older, and mellower, and perhaps the band is too.

I'm pretty surprised by the amount of support and kudos that were given to this album. Is it safe to assume that most were written by hard-core Britney fans? A while ago I received a copy of this album. Obviously I was curious to see what the quality of the album would be like, esp. with the drama surrounding her personal life. It doesn't seem like a person in such a distressed mental state could possibly produce a decent album. Well, my instincts proved correct, I feel this album is a complete pile. This album is SO heavily produced, even more so than her previous albums. Britney's vocals are basically non-existent. We all know that she doesn't have singing abilities but at least on previous efforts, she had ballads to showcase her "vocal abilities". On Blackout, her voice is completely synthesized on practically every track. It reminds of me of Zapp and Roger songs from back in the day. Her lyrics are lame and very elementary. "I'm Miss Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"? As I continued to listen to the album, I felt is was such poor quality that I found myself tuning out and ignoring it all together. The songs all had  similar tunes and seemed to have the same style. It's as if you're listening to the same song over and over. In all honesty, I'm not a big Britney fan. However, I've admittedly enjoyed some of her songs and feel that my opinion isn't biased. If Britney had taken this album a little more seriously, it could have been a big comeback for her. Instead, it leaves little to be desired and re-iterates her sagging reputation as a train wreck. It may debut at #1 but it'll hardly reach the same success she's accustomed to.

I downloaded this album within the first hour it became available-- that's how much I had been looking forward to this.  I couldn't wait for it to come out.  I have been a fan of Robert Plant since grade school and a fan of Alison Krauss for the past several years. When I first heard of this collaborative effort, I was very excited. That said, this album just isn't groundbreaking and isn't innovative and isn't as remarkable as it truly could have been.  It misses the mark. It's good and it is enjoyable, but it isn't wonderful.The first couple of times I listened, I was busy doing other things and I was left with the impression that it was an Alison Krauss record in which Robert Plant sung back-up.  That's how un-new it is.  Obviously, I felt obliged to listen again, and I realized that Plant did more on here than I originally thought, but, still-- this is all Alison Krauss' STYLE.  Robert Plant is doing country and Americana music and much of his music from Led Zeppelin through his solo efforts have integrated much of this before.  He's bringing nothing new to this table.   And, when he tries to bring his authentic Plant vocalizations-- improvising a bit at the end of a couple of songs, it just doesn't work too well.  His voice is as strong as it ever was, but when he does that Zeppelin-esque improvisation, it seems to be sorely out of place.  Additionally, the strong Plant stuff here is very reminiscent of the Honeydrippers.  Robert Plant sounds great on every song here (save for aforementioned Zeppelin-esque vocalizations that would have sounded wonderful elsewhere) as does Krauss. However, Krauss is doing her thing here. . . this is her element. I don't hear anything NEW here, that she hasn't done before-- you won't find her "rocking" here and you won't find anything as perfect as _Battle of Evermore_-- which would have been great with Alison Krauss singing along-- imagine her doing Sandy Denny's part!That's actually what I was hoping from this album. I was hoping we'd see some unbelievable duets here. Something like Battle of Evermore. And, it could have been that good, but it's just not.  Their straight duets are Alison Krauss with Robert Plant singing harmony/backup. On those songs, one wouldn't even KNOW it's Robert Plant. . . his participation doesn't shine through.  They're GOOD songs, but they are definitely songs that cause Krauss to shine, not Plant.On Plant's efforts where he sings lead or solo, I don't even really hear Krauss at all.  His songs are good, too, but they are not phenomenal.  On a side note, here's one more thing that bothered me (not too much, just a little).  Some of these songs are written from a man's point of view and Alison sings lead.  I always find that a bit disconcerting. Why can't she change the lyric to "her" instead of "him" or "he" instead of "she"? It's not that big a deal, and it's definitely more common to hear this in country artists, but I wonder what the motivation is when one makes that choice?I wanted to add this: I also purchased Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris' CD, All the Roadrunning, when that first came out. And, although many of you might absolutely LOVE Emmylou Harris, I never did. I never really liked her voice.  I have heard people singing her praises for years and years, but I never liked it as much as the other folk singers of her generation. However, that's a wonderful CD! The collaborative efforts of Knopfler and Harris ARE what this CD should have been.  That CD IS much more innovative than this CD.  I have always loved Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler's solo work, but I have LOVED Robert Plant's voice and style sine the fifth grade!  I think Alison Krauss' voice is gorgeous and much better than Emmylou Harris' voice which grates on me after a while.  That said, Raising Sand misses the mark and Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris' CD hits it.

Let's face it, Bruce made his millions and now he's trying to shake off his rich man's guilt by jumping on the mindless, antiwar bandwagon that is so popular with effete hollywood snobs. The dishonesty in his music is now palpable. Don't waste your money on this bore.

I've played REVIVAL a half dozen times hoping it would finally click, but it just lays there for some reason, and one thing that really bothered me was the drummer seemed to have trouble with Fogerty's simple grooves. Also, it really hurts me to say that the songs simply aren't that good, and not up to the level of CCR, or even Centerfield. I'm also hearing one musical clich after another, and yet most people will probably like the album for that very reason. There's nothing like that ol' familiar blanket right? I, on the other hand, like my favorite artists to look forward musically and not fall into the nostalgia trap and become a parody of themselves. There are a couple songs that would be worthy on Mardi Gras, but that's not saying a lot. Maybe I just don't connect with Fogerty and the swamp rock image anymore. Finally, the sound quality isn't as good as it could have been, thanks again to over compression. It's a far cry from that analog warmth of those old CCR records. By the way, the final track "Longshot," sounded a lot like ELO's Ma-Ma-Ma Belle.

If you like this CD, it will have nothing to do with Britney.  The producers, musicians etc. made cool songs.  But Britney's "singing" is so painful that it just ruins them.

After a few months of waiting, I've finally got a copy of John's new CD, Revival.  I was shocked when I heard about this album coming out, not having to wait almost 10 years again.While I don't really think this album is quite as good as most people are saying, there are some songs on it that I really enjoy.  Songs like "Gunslinger", "Don't You Wish It Was True", and "Summer Of Love" will definitely be considered some of my favorite Fogerty songs.  "Creedence Song" was good, even though it's just another remake of "Green River"; I like it a little more than "Wicked Old Witch" from Deja Vu.The only songs I didn't like much were "Broken Down Cowboy" and "River Is Waiting".  Not because they are slower songs, but because they just don't go anywhere.  "River Is Waiting" is more like nice background music.So in the end, I don't think that this is John's best album since his Creedence days (I still think that Blue Moon Swamp and Centerfield were better albums), but it is still much better than Eye Of The Zombie and his 1975 self-titled album.

Being a fan of Led Zeppelin, I was disappointed that this album does not show off some of the powerhouse voice of Robert Plant. However, this is a nice easy to listen to CD, so I don't think I've wasted my money. I would have loved to hear more of the power of the voices involved, but the Plant and Krauss' voices do blend well, and the songs are pleasant to listen to. I don't feel any of the individual tracks really jumps out and says "this is great", however.

During it's pre release I heard a few songs on XM radio and thought I'd give it a full listen, so I bought the CD. Since that day I've only played a few cuts from it. Robert Plant's voice is still amazing considering his age. Alison Krauss has the sweetest voice in her genre, and together they do compliment each other. BUT, at times it does get a bit "twangy" and "nasal" for my taste. There are a few cuts where it sounds like they did their own thing rather than a collaboration. Overall I'm not very happy with this CD because, like so many other CDs I own, I only end up listening to one or two tracks and skipping the rest.

I love Annie Lennox. I have been a fan of her music since her days with The Eurythmics. I also love her work as a solo artist...until now. I have been looking forward to hearing her new album SONGS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. I heard samples of her new album in the store and liked what I heard. Unfortunately when I listened to the album in its entirety I was left unimpressed. Personally I think Annie's strength lies in her ballads like "Dark Road", "Lost", and "Coloured Bedspread". Her soulful voice gives those songs an emotional depth without verging on the treacly territory of Celine Dion. Her uptempo tempo songs like "Womankind" and worse yet "Sing" are dreadful, especially "Sing". I didn't like the melodies or Annie's vocals which tended to be loud and bombastic. My personal favorite song on the entire cd is the lovely "Coloured Bedspread". It is a beautiful ballad. Too bad I can't say the same for most of the album. SONGS OF MASS DESTRUCTION was a big letdown for me.

Let me start by saying that I have Josh Groban's other CDs and I like them a  lot. So maybe my expectations were unrealistically high when I purchased "Noel" but it is a complete disappointment to me.

I'm surprised at the good reviews that this album has received. This sounds more like Eddie & The Cruisers than Bruce Springsteen. Several of the songs sound as if they came from an Eddie Money album of the late 70's.Springsteen has put out a pop album, not a rock album. I heard that when the disco-based Rolling Stones album 'Some Girls' came out, several Stones purists grabbed it off the turntable and smashed it against the wall.  I get the same feeling listening to this. Unfortunately, I can't  get the indestructable CD to smash against the wall.It's overproduced and almost unlistenable. It has violins. Violins on a Springsteen album!!!!!Plus, Springsteen repeats several choruses over and over and over and over. I think he repeats "Your own worst enemy" about thirty-five time during the song. It's boring, annoying, and repetitive.Yes, some of the songs are catchy, such as "Radio Nowhere", but they sound more bubble-gum than rock. Leave this pop music to Tiffany and Brittany Spears.I am a fan of Springsteen's "River" era, along with 'Nebraska' and even "Tunnel of Love", and I enjoyed his "Born in the USA"  period, but this new album just doesn't do it for me. I wish it did.

I should say that if you like Bruce, you will like this album. To me this is not a great album, just OK. Mostly, I can't get over the terrible mix. It is muddy, almost noisy and sounds and feels pieced together. I can't believe a record with his budget was released this way. Maybe it's all they had to work with. As a band, Bruce and the E-Street Band have never sounded tight to me, but that was part of their allure; gritty music. This record is just too gritty. Listen in headphones and you'll hear it what I'm talking about.

The first of the Beatles colour cinematic outings, Help actually is quite funny.<p>Co-starring the late great Leo McKern (better know outside the USA), the Beatles are pursued by a religious sect after a sacred ring which just happens to be on 'you-know-who's' finger.<p>I'm surprised though that this is so expensive!

Bruce is pushing 60 and he still writes better songs than anybody else these days. That is as much a compliment to Bruce as it is a major rip on today's music. This album is good but I agree with many about the mediocre sound of this album - if you have a nice system you will hear how bad the sound is immediately. No excuses and it cost him a few stars. Plus, the ESB has always been more attitude than talent - they need better mixing than this. Mostly good songs here, with great lyrics. Bruce is always good for a few cheesy tunes and doesnt disappoint with the likes of Summer Clothes -he was going for Brian Wilson but gave us Mike Love instead. Bermuda, Bahamas....

If you're a Beatles fan and also if you aren't, you should buy Help! because it shows you once more how big were those four youngsters from Liverpool.<br>If you've seen you, you might say something like since when these musicians became actors?, and you may right, but it still shouldn't change the fact that this movie is a good one, but different from A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, for example. If you haven't seen this one and already saw A HARD DAY'S NIGHT or THE FIRST U.S VISIT, you may be dissapointed after you'll see this one. However, I reccomend you to take this one. You may regret, but not for long.

Alright. Well. This COULD be a great record. The song writing is great and as usual, whenever the E Street Band is there, Magic happens. Every song on the album is going to sound AMAZING live, but on the record... not so much. With the exception of the last 2 songs, the entire album is way over-produced. You can hear the melody, but it is impossible to hear what the heck is going on. The instruments are smushed together, so to speak. And what happened to that great drum production they had on the Rising? GONE. They sound like they are being played a mile away. Do I recommend buying this? Sure. But don't expect yourself to listen to it too much or for it to have any re-play value. It is a record you listen to every day for a week and then put it away and take it out every couple of months (the production is really annoying). If this thing was re-produced, or in my view, re-mastered, it would be one of Bruce's best albums.

The album is better from tracks 8-11 with noteworthy mention of "Last to Die" and "Long Walk Home", but the rest of the album sounds computer generated; overly repititioons and with melodies that high school bands could have probably come up with. Most of these songs are below Springsteen's typical capability (with the exception of the Rising) and if it wasn't for the E-street band and clever mixing it would sound even worse than it does. With the additional releases this year and last of a live, remasted and a cover album, perhaps Springsteen and the recording label are really only looking to generate income even if at the expense of musical talent. Perhaps one reason for the outstanding reviews is that Springsteen is becoming ever more alone in his 80's style rock phenomenon with little in comparison.

As usual Fogerty cannot desist from ramming his far left political sloganising and cliches down the throats of his record buying public. Bush Derangment Syndrome ruins this decidedly bitty offering. The first five songs are good/even very good but then the horribly discordant middle of the cd is ruined by typically simpleton and simplistic Bush hate so beloved of so many smug rock n roll lefties who are mostly UNDENIABLY dullards when it comes to the more demanding big picture matters involved in post 9/11 geo-politics.   I saw Fogerty a while back in Atlanta on the double header tour with J Melloncrap, at least Fogerty refrained from the usual political diatribe and he was quite superb (unlike the other John from IN) that steamy summer night in Dixie. His upcoming December concert in Cobb County GA will hopefully be just as good - much longer and free of any leftist political ranting.  It will be mildly amusing to watch how many lefties robotically slam my review because I choose to exercise **my free speech rights** to make the point about Fogerty's politics, just as a number of them express their satisfaction with Fogerty's obtuse Bush hate. Just stick to the music John and everyone wins. About half this album is top notch and half of it is filler/political drivel.  Why can't someone tell lefties that screeching about Bush and 'terrorist detainees' etc on a cd is NOT either original or a great musical choice. A wee bit more of his inimitable swamp rock and the cd would have been much better. Fogerty has more than earned the right over a couple of generations now to be considered as one of America's finest rock n roll songwriters/performers. Why can't he just settle for that??

A total studio creation. Where's the real talent? I find it hillarious when some people say that this is the album of the year, LOL! It's so funny. I don't hate Britney, she's a human being and she has made many, many, many mistakes, but no one is perfect, but trying to pass her as a real musical artist is simply hillarious! Everything here sounds so computerized, it's so fake. Ask her to sing LIVE in front of a microphone ACCAPELLA and lets see if she can sing. I doubt it very much. This album is what it is, total make-believe!

Not up to the book, but tries valiantly to capture the realtionship between the 2 witches ( pre Dorothy). Works 80% of the time, a little less music and a little more character and plot development would have helped. Still, some fine tunes, dazzling effects and powerhouse performances by Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenowith. While I didn't leave the theater feeling elated, I wasn't disappointed either. Not a great musical, but pleasant!

A hint for those who love classic storytelling: Any time you see a synopsis starting "In this Postmodern, Feminist retelling of...", run for the hills. I saw the musical Wicked  at LA's Pantages theater with my family. While my girls (ages 11 and 13) thought it was OK, and I loved the Victorian sci-fi settings, costumes and such, the story about how the Wicked Witch of the West was really just a brilliant, misunderstood animal rights activist persecuted by the Evil George W. Bu... er, Wizard of Oz, who is using her imaginary "terror" as a pretext for turning Oz into a police state, had me grinding my teeth throughout. That said, the performances were generally great or at least good (except for the guy who played Fiyero, who couldn't carry a tune), in some cases superior to those on the official cast CD. My girls have had the CD in the car stereo on and off for the last few days, prompting this review. As a general observation, the music and lyrics are sub-par for a hit musical, with very few memorable melodies or lyrical turns of phrase. Virtually every number has a long, meandering preamble that morphs into the "song" in precisely the same way. The standouts for me were "Popular," a cute take on High School-College social climbing that has a nice, syncopated feel, and "I'm Not That Girl," a beautifully restrained and meloncholy meditation on life and love. "Defying Gravity," the big set-piece number, has a soaring chorus, but I defy anyone to hum, or even identify the verse melody. The rest of the tunes have a Broadway by-the-numbers feel that leaves me cold.

Obviously, Carrie listened to all of the Nashville critics, and actually made a straightforward Country album.  As many of you are well aware, Nashville didn't throughly embrace Carrie as a Country artist, since her debut album was more of a Pop Album with Country undertones.  However, she made a bold move, and dropped the Pop sound entirely, and went ahead and made a Country CD..... and it doesn't work, for a number of reasons.This album sounds forced from beginning to end.  There's none of that free flowing, goosebump giving kind of music that the first album offered.  I listened to this entire CD 3 different times, and realized, there's really not a good song on the entire CD.  "Last Name" would have to be the best song, if there is one.  "All American Girl" sounds forced, and I'm not buying it.  This was an enormous letdown, and I'm completely baffled by the many positive reviews this album received on here.  It's simply NOT a good CD, at all.  Carrie's still adorably beautiful though. :)

Being a Robert Plant fan, I try to give a listen to everything he does.  I pre-ordered this CD on the basis of the preview clips here at Amazon, which (at the time) struck me as beautiful and creative.Well, somewhere between my listening to the clips and my 3 times listen-through of this CD something got lost.The vocals are great, their voices very compatible.  But other than that...Turgid.  Tempos so slow (in the main) as to be irritating.  Murky, bloated-bass recording, banal accompaniment.  The whole thing makes me squirm with impatience, and the few examples of heavenly harmony aren't enough to compensate.I wasted my money here.  T Bone has done such good things in the past, both personally and as a producer, as have Plant and Krauss, of course.But this surely ain't it.

I don't know the cause of the problem, but I was not able to play this CD on my Windows Vista laptop. I tried using Windows Media Player and Itunes, and neither worked. Each time the laptop's software could not play the audio out loud and the length of the tracks appeared as 789 minutes. I am guessing there is a copy protection issue, but this malicous software (alledged) not only kept me from being able to play it, but it destroyed 72 other tracks that I had legal rights to own (having purchased the CD or having purchased the track on the Itunes store). I was able to play it in my car, and while the music was excellent in quality, every song was terribly depressing.

Sorry Bruce fans and casual listeners, but this album is nowhere near his best.  None of the songs have the fresh punch from Born to Run, Darkness, or River nor the interesting feels of Nebraska, Rising, or Seeger Sessions.  The songs and arrangements are formulaic.  I won't comment on the production quality which has already been solidly criticized,  The only song I find 1/2 interesting is "Girls in their summer clothes."  Many of the sax solos feel forced, like someone was thinking "I need to get a Clarence solo in here someplace."  In a nutshell what's missing is the fun Jersey shore party sounds aka 10th Ave Freezeout, Sherry Darling, Hungry Heart and the deeper tunes like Darkness, River, Independence Day and the Price you Pay.

I bought this CD in order to familiarize myself with the music before going to the concert.  I'm a bit disappointed in some of the songs.  I absolutely loved all of the songs on "The Rising".  The first 3 or 4 songs on this new CD are fine, but the rest of them sound very similar to each other and are quite dark and almost depressing.  It leaves me wanting to hear something more uplifting.  Also I find a lot of the songs on this album formulaic in that they all follow the same format of number of verses and choruses and repetition, repetition, repetition.

When "Help!" made its video debut in 1987, several critics overrated the film after its long absence from television and revival houses. Nostalgic memories can be deceiving. Despite the influential visual style and offbeat humor, this 1965 Beatles romp lacks the charm and spontaneity of "A Hard Day's Night." The paper-thin plot (a religious cult pursues Ringo for wearing a red-jeweled sacrificial ring) is no better than the typical Elvis musical. Strangely enough, director Richard Lester does not allow John, Paul, George and Ringo to dominate the proceedings -- instead, they share screen time with a fine array of British character actors (notably Leo McKern, Victor Spinetti, Roy Kinnear and Patrick Cargill). Lester's cinematic frenticism, though amusing at first, eventually grows tiresome without a decent storyline. Nevertheless, the Fab Four's memorable numbers -- "You're Going to Lose That Girl," "I Need You," "You've Got to Hide Your Love Away" and the classic "Ticket to Ride" -- remain historic music-video prototypes. Special praise also should be given to David Watkin's Eastmancolor cinematography. Compared to the overall brilliance of "A Hard Day's Night," the big-budget "Help!" survives as an erratic farce punctuated by magical Beatle moments.

I'm a die-hard Alison fan.  Indeed, i literally worship everything she and Union Station have done since day one.  Really, I have loved her since back in the day of Hee Haw and the Cox Family and going forward.  I love her so much.  Plus, I grew up in the rock and roll of Led Zep.  What an anticipation of this pairing!  My gosh, the best of bluegrass and the best of rock.  Never have I pre-ordered a CD until now with such anticipation of an amazing amalgam.But, I'm so sorry to say that this tanks.  There's no bluegrass.  There's no rock & roll.  They sort of stab at a little country sound but what we have here are a few hacknyed rockabilly tunes which, frankly, sound like they belong in an old Elvis movie score.  I kept thinking "Girl Happy".  Not that there's anything wrong with that but gee whiz, the King did that 40 years ago and better.  The other tunes are Russian gypsy strumming stuff that frankly puts me to sleepers.I wish they had kicked it up a notch or 100.  God bless you both for trying (and the harmonies hold such promise!) but I think you need to stick to your genres.

"It's Britney, bitch."Halloween night here at Twin Oaks and no one is especially psyched about, or even aware of, the new Britney Spears effort - except me. Britney, I think, is a fine disturbing idol for any aspiring transsexual; artificial, inscrutable and bold. "Miss bad media karma, another day, another drama."So how's the comeback of the century come out? Not too shabby for a millennium Janis!"Piece of Me" is delinquent technogrunge, "Radar" is militant bling and "Freakshow" is headrush pottymouth. Love that shrill, stripped down android sound! Forget the hit single thang, though, it's just a shrinkwrapped Madonna demo. (#1? Tha customer is always right, I suppose. "Hot As Ice," boom boom, is another corporate contender.) Lotsa goodies throughout: "Heaven On Earth" and "Break The Ice" are dope, "Get Naked" is a sleazy hoot and "Toy Soldier" is demonic insane. Kool noise! Kinda runs outta steam towards the finish line, though. Alotta of the pirate tracks didn't make the cut; where's "Love Is A State Of Grace"? Ooops! Britney didn't even get her website up running for this release! And, hey, I was dreaming of a Sinead O'Conner "hairdo" shot in the liner notes. No disrespectful covers, boo hoo; I'd love to hear Britney demolish "Rapture"! Or duet with Alice Cooper!On the other hand, my copy sports a sample of Britney's new fragrance, BELIEVE - and it's better than the Cher tune! That said, BLACKOUT is more exciting than Annie Lennox's freezedried latest - eternal trash, transmogrified boogie, toxic disco, tickertape, nitrous oxide.I turned tricks for this CD - and loved every minute of it. Let's Charleston one more time!

I  have been to  several  bruce  springteen shows and i own most of his  catalogue. so, i don't think i am a novice to the boss.  this album has some bright moments. but,  58 year old  bruce is  just a bit too distracted  with his  concerns  for the iraq  war and his disdain of the bush adminstration to get a really great  album off the ground.  the lyrics on a couple of songs are  very good ( last to die ). on  other songs, ( i'll work for your love ) the  words are forced.  I watched a  few of bruce's live videos on his website from  his current tour. he seems to be resting on his  laurels  while the e-street band  sleeps.   i am from atlanta  where he  recorded this album and the rising. basically,  bruce sits locked  up with his producer brendan o,  on the horth side of  town.  these two  make all the music and  cut the tracks and then take the  work back for the  street  band to lay on the finishing touches. so, the last two  albums  ought to be titled " bruce  and brendan in duet." i think you can see the e street band sleep walking through another " statement " album.  thank goodness the e street band  can  play. i think they took a bunch of mediocre bruce and brendan songs and  made them above average. now, i know   i am  going against the grain, here by saying the king has no clothes. but, the boss needs to give up on using his high school diploma to  write editorials into his  music and  go back to  rocking the house. or, maybe this is  what comes  of a rocker pushing 60.

After hearing the first few leaked tracks on the Internet (including the unintentially funny Oompa-Loompa beat of "Hot as Ice") and seeing her MTV Video Music Awards disasterpiece, this record looked like it was going to be a dud. Surprisingly (or not so surprising, according to her fans), "Blackout" is something of a minor dancefloor classic-in-the-making."Gimme More" is possibly the second best song of Ms. Spears's career, behind "Toxic." "Piece of Me," "Freakshow," and "Toy Soldier" offer equal bubblegum pleasures. There are several missteps, however, especially when the tempo lets up. Still, Ms. Spears's producers deserve mucho credit for wringing this album out of the troubled starlet.

I love the music but because the sound quality is so bad I will never listen to again. I thought that Rush's Snakes & Arrows was the worst sounding cd of 2007 but it has been surpassed by this recording. In a time when people are buying fewer and fewer CD's, I think the artist and the record company owes it to us, the buyers of the WHOLE cd, not just the GOOD tracks, to have the good sense to make them sound as good as they can. If you not sure of my golden ears, just listen back to back two cds that were release on the same day, Bruce Springsteen Magic and John Fogerty Revival. If you want to know what a cd should sound like buy the John Fogerty cd!

The first single I got my parents to buy for me when I was a child was "Green River" and the very first vinyl record I ever bought was "Creedence Gold", so you could say that I've been a fan of CCR and John Fogerty for a long time.  I wish this really was a "revival" of the old CCR days (of course, I don't know for sure if that's what the title is alluding to).  I pre-ordered this CD because I wanted to believe it would be that way, but it just isn't.I'm happy that John is still making music, and I hope he keeps at it until he drops.  He's still got the energy and the voice, but in order to be objective I had to distance myself from my history of loving CCR and Fogerty's music, and just write about what I heard.  Here goes.Don't You Wish is Was True -- Seems strangely appropriate that the first song on this new John Fogerty CD on the Fantasy label should be a fantasy itself.  Catchy and fun, but is it a precursor to the reat of the CD?  I wish it was true.Gunslinger - an energetic if not too memorable song about how the world is going to hell.  Yup, maybe we could use a few gunslingers.  At least John leaves it to the listener's imagination as to who exactly is to blame for all this chaos.Creedence song - A Blue Moon Swamp sounding song about Creedence songs.  Funny!  And he's right too!  Can't miss with that Creedence song!Broken Down Cowboy - A sad and mellow ballad about that actually works very well.  Mothers, don't let your daughters grow up to marry broken down cowboys.River is Waiting -- A beautiful gospelesque tune with female backup vocalists.  I wish John would do more stuff like this.Long Dark Night -- Oh no!! George Bush is hiding in the jungle waiting to take my children and send them to war!  (Did the draft get reinstated while I wasn't looking?)  This is Bush Drangement Syndrom set to music.   Will I make it through the Long Dark Night (that would be one more year more-or-less)?  Better run through the jungle!  Wait, that's where Goerge is!  What will I do?!Summer of Love -- A high energy rocker with a power chords and some heavy guitar leads.  Jimi Hendrix meets Susie Q. Natural Thing -- This song sounds like rehash of Hot Rod Heart from Blue Moon Swamp, and it deals with some stuff about men that ain't gonna change any time soon.  They're natural things.  An echo of the old CCR song Bootleg.It Ain't Right -- A very Creedence sounding rocker about narcissistic pop-tarts who are always in and out of rehab.  There's certainly been enough of those in the news lately. I wish this idea had been developed more.I Can't Take it no More -- More Bush derangement syndrome set to music, and even more frenetic music than Long Dark Night.  This epic two-chord anti Bush frenzy clocks in at one minute and thirty nine seconds.  One thing that I can't take any more is baby boomer era rockers trying to exploit the Iraq war.  If the war is so bad, why aren't the protest songs better?  Isn't this is the guy who wrote "Fortunate Son", the greatest protest song ever?Somebody Help Me -- A plodding blues rocker about a man searchin' the world tryin' to find his baby who left him.  Long Shot -- Yeah!!  Straight ahead rock 'n roll without the signature Fogerty guitar twang but with that great voice in top form.  A great one to end this uneven CD with. So, the best word I can use to describe this CD is "uneven".  And sadly, I don't hear anything that I would predict will be a classic twenty or thirty years from now, when they'll still be playin' those Creedence songs.

I bought all of my friends copies of "Bare" when it was released. It's very rare an album moves me like that one did.

The one thing I like about this is the way they've packaged a new EP with the greatest hits.  It's  much better than most bands who record a couple of new songs and throw them on the same disc with the greatest hits just to get old fans to buy it.  Usually those songs aren't up to par and ruin the rest of the album.  Take REM's In Time compilation, for example.  The problem I have with this is that matchbox twenty have only released 3 albums, the last of which was short and somewhat uninspired compared to their first two.  If they're calling it quits, they should offer their fans a "Best Of" album with a few more than just 11 songs.  Personally, I've liked some of their album tracks better than their singles. However, if they're planning to stay together they should've just released the EP and waited for a greatest hits album.  Even bands like Korn and Oasis waited until they'd released 5-6 albums before putting out greatest hits. You can get $5 compilations at Wal-Mart with more songs than this.  The only reason I'd recommend buying this would be if you don't have their previous albums and don't really care about anything other than singles.  Personally, I think it's just a cry for attention from a band that's obviously more interested in its side projects.

I used to have a rule I lived by before any CD was purchased, I had to have heard and liked at least two songs before I would plunk down my money. Wish I had used that critera before buying this CD. I'll get my biggest gripe out of the way first: whoever told her to cover I Told You So, should be fired. Its always risky covering a classic, but you can do it if, a) you make it your own, b) it makes your voice shine. This song-singer combination did neither. The rest of the songs weren't bad, as such, but neither were they good. It was like listening to songs that had copied other songs but weren't nearly as good--the first that comes to mind is, "Last Name", which wasn't as funny as or enjoyable to listen to as "I don't even know her name" by Alan Jackson. Basically, the CD isn't bad, but its not one I want to own (I have already given away the one I bought).

First, let me say I'm a huge fan of both of them.  I have all their CDs, seen Alison 7 times, Robert w/ & w/o the Zep 8 times.   When I heard about this CD back in the summer I was astonished & excited about the pairing.Well, it's hear & boy, what a letdown.  Sure the voices are still great, but the material is mostly slow & drags down the whole lp.  Gone, Gone, Gone is the one outstanding track.  It has energy, rhythm, great duet singing.  There are a few other ok tracks, but the bulk of the slow songs drag those down too.I'm wondering if in the hands of someone like Lindsey Buckingham who's commercial yet quirky, a more enjoyable lp could be made.This reminds me of the Page-Plant lp, Walking into Clarksdale where the pairing looks great on paper but when the actual lp was issued, it was a slow & dull record, not one for repeated listening.I hope Alison & Robert make another record, but next time please more energy & fun.

As the winner of the television show "Britain's Got Talent", Paul Potts was a revelation.  A cell phone saleman with a shyness factor as high as the sky, he was the least likely to be noticed until he opened his mouth.  His voice is clear and crisp and the emotion he feels while singing is genuine and comes through effortlessly.  This recording does him justice in not being overproduced where his voice can shine in all its glory.  Granted, he's no Pavarotti, (but where's the need - we already had one), however he does indeed have talent and his rags to riches story makes it all the more compelling.

One of my movie faves growing up was always Help!  I was very disappointed that the 5.1 surround mix was only available for DTS and not Dolby 5.1 (just like Queens' Night At The Opera!!) I must say that the 2-track musical content sounded very fresh and remixed, but I wish the ads had mentioned DTS SURROUND ONLY - I might not have spent top dollar and pre-ordered.  After the brilliant Dolby surround mixes in The Beatles LOVE set, you can understand the frustration. The other letdown was the "missing scene."  They only talk about it, show several stills and interview the leading lady of that scene (who didn't know she was cut from the film until she went to the premiere). The picture looks excellent, better than my Hong Kong DVD of Help!, purchased years ago, but that "import" had many extras that this set doesn't offer.  Next time, get me good British plugs - it's up to you - the voters!

As someone who has every CD of hers and many Led Zepplen Albums/CD's I didn't know what to expect. Alison I hope that this is a one time diversion or you are committing career sucide with your long time fans.  The two voices were good together but songs were so low key that I was depressed after listening to it.  I did listen to it a second time just in case I was judging by first impression!  I wasn't expecting any classics like Stairway to Heaven but I don't think there was a song in the bunch that really even comes close as a classic.

I just finished reading ( and writing ) a couple Nick Cave & Joy Division reviews here on amazon. I popped over to Britney because my six year old niece is a fan and we listened to  a single on the Internet.  I forget what it was called ( Gimme something maybe, but it wasn't shelter, which the poor girl seems to need ) but it had something to do with what I'd rather my angelic niece not ask about yet.What struck me is the difference of language use in the former bands' reviews and Britney's. And language, thought, inspiration really have nothing to do with this type of product. But it will sell.  "Saw IV" is the #1 movie at the box office right now.  "Control" will probably open and close stuck in limited release.That's America kids. This is product driven by corporations like Disney. Am I saying Britney Spear's is not thinking persons' music?  Yes I am. Does it matter?  Not to you if you buy this stuff.  I can only hope you meet someone who exposes you to great music someday.  It's never too late.

What happened to O Holy Night? Also, would have like to have heard I'll be Home for Christmas uninterrupted. I'll know I'll be critiqued by all the Grobanites out there for saying anything negative about their beloved.

Ladies!  You can watch The Guiding Light or listen to these tunes.  Take your pick!  Bruce Inc.'s fulsome lack of irony, insight, and art is on display here as it has been for 30 years.  Ancient, simple, tired cadences.  Faux tough guy.  Faux working class.  He may be dumb--but knows how to screw his face into a sort-of scowl (maybe it was the bad veal).  He created 2 good albums in the early 70s.  Other than that...  Do yourselves a favor and stick with Tom Jones.

I am probably the only person who was totally disappointed in this album. There can be no arguement that Josh Groban has an incredible voice. But it certainly not suited for what he attempted. I honestly find only one cut that equalled his talent. Panus Angelicus was brilliant. The rest were woefully lacking. How is it that a man with such a heavenly voice could mangle so many Christmas carols? Why is it that he seemed incapable or unwilling to stick to the melody of the music. Most of these carols have been around for hundreds of years for a reason. They aren't broken so don't try to fix them.Oh well, I can always hope the next album will be back to the standards we have grown to expect from such a master.

I smell a Grammy, but not because it's a good record.  The combination of these two great artists together, plus the "Emperor's New Clothes" phenomenon, seems to be fooling people into thinking something great is going on here.Well, the first four songs, one after another, put me into a stupor.  I woke up a bit around song 5 (Gone Gone Gone) and the second half of the album is more varied than the first.  But overall, this is 21st century elevator music.  I've been a big fan of Alison Krauss for 20 years.  She has a phenomenal voice and can sing anything, as well as being a fantastic fiddle and viola player.  On this record, both she and Plant sound wonderful individually and their voices blend beautifully.  So what's the problem?  This is very much a ballad album with a majority of the songs in the low-energy category, and taken as a whole, it's downright boring.  The concept of pairing these two is ingenious, and I wouldn't mind hearing a different CD where they open up and really sing, and the material supports their full range of talents.  But for now, I have absolutely no interest in listening to Raising Sand a second time, and that says it all.  This CD is in my "play this when I need something to put me to sleep" pile.  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.

Brittany Spears continues to put out garbage and the mindless youths of our day continue to support any kind of trash this trashy young woman produces.   It is a testament to her lack of musical talent and a poor voice.  Brittany Spears is simply a youthful fad (who will eventually fade away into obscurity in her luxury double-wide trailer) who makes a mockery of what is normal and decent.

I think it's important to point out the difference between Britney Spears the woman and Britney Spears the product. Britney the woman is clearly troubled; her recent meltdowns widely documented and talked about. But with "Blackout", it's clear that Britney the woman's well-being isn't essential to the continuing success of Britney the product. All that was clearly necessary to create a slick, entertaining pop album for Britney the product was for Britney the woman to be able to get it together enough times over the past two years to come into the studio and lay down some vocals ... and let the army of songwriters, producers and recording engineers do the rest.There is much to be enjoyed in "Blackout" if you're a pop music fan (and I am). It's full of sexy, glitzy, dizzying musical candy. If Britney had made an album that reflected her current real emotional state, it would probably sound something like Courtney Love's last album. But "Blackout" continues the fantasy life of Britney the product, who has grown from sexy, coy teenage nymphet to full-fledged glamazon temptress, now enjoying her sexuality with complete abandon.

The real disappointment with Magic is not the content, but the very poor sound quality - at least on my CD copy, purchased from a major retailer in Alberta, Canada.The entire CD sounds like a mp3 compression (perhaps it is) - the dynamic range is very compressed, individual instruments are muddy, and the soundstage is non-existent. For those used to, say, the very high quality of the recordings of the LP version of Born in the USA, or the CDs of The Rising, or even the recent Dublin sessions, this is a huge turn-off.In fact, it sounds like a back-street garage recording. We have come to expect better from Springsteen's producers.As I write this, my other half has come into the room where this CD is playing on my very high end audiophile equipment - this is the first time she has heard the CD - and, totally unaware I am writing this, has just said: Is this a CD? It's terrible. It sounds like the radio.Quite.What a pity. Perhaps someone could report on the sound quality of the LP veriosn, if they have managed to get hold of one in North America.

I've played REVIVAL a half dozen times hoping it would finally click, but it just lays there for some reason, and one thing that really bothered me was the drummer seemed to have trouble with Fogerty's simple grooves. Also, it really hurts me to say that the songs simply aren't that good, and not up to the level of CCR, or even Centerfield. I'm also hearing one musical clich after another, and yet most people will probably like the album for that very reason. There's nothing like that ol' familiar blanket right? I, on the other hand, like my favorite artists to look forward musically and not fall into the nostalgia trap and become a parody of themselves.  There are a couple songs that would be worthy on Mardi Gras, but that's not saying a lot. The nine reviews below me seem to really like it, but that might be based on nostalgia and loving those CCR clichs. Maybe I just don't connect with Fogerty and the swamp rock image anymore. Finally, the sound quality isn't as good as it could have been, thanks again to over compression. It's a far cry from that analog warmth of those old CCR records. By the way, the final track "Longshot," sounded a lot like ELO's Ma-Ma-Ma Belle.

Medicore at best--way overproduced but still not with a strong voice or vocals--many lyrics are unintelligible--way too much noise, not music.  I've seen him 3 times, twice with THE Band(1976-77).  Nothing seems to be fun anymore just a bleak grind.  Any of his first 5 albums are better than this dark cloud--another reviewer was right, these songs sound like bad leftovers from The Rising.  Anyone who thinks this is something more than an average album is listening with memory and faith and not with a musical ear.

To be quick and to the point I'll say this: this is an album for only three kinds of people. Britney fans (and fanatics), people who will dance to anything with a heavy thudding electronic beat, and people who don't mind when studio production far, far, far outshines the artist. If you're one of those three kinds of people then Britney's Blackout will be right up your alley. However, if you're simply curious about what kind of artistic creativity was born of such a sad fiasco of a personal life, then I suggest you listen to the whole album online for free while you still can. I was one of the curious ones who listened to Blackout online, and while I will admit that there is plenty of catchy fluff on the album it's difficult for me to overlook the fact that the high points of it are owed almost entirely to the producers rather than Britney herself. The fact is, and we've all heard it before, that Britney has very limited vocal range. Every single track on Blackout is so overproduced that Britney's voice is hardly recongnizable, and when it is you're quickly reminded of why it needed to be tweaked in the first place. Things start off well with the lead single Gimme More, but it goes downhill from there. Pieces of Me brings one word to mind: noisy. Very electronic, but not very listenable. Then there's Radar which isn't quite as bad, but it feels so bland about a minute into listening that I found myself wanting to skip again. Break the Ice has Britney's voice sounding pretty good for her and it sounds like the kind of generic song that could be a hit on the radio, but it doesn't do too much for me personally. Heaven on Earth sounds a lot like a Paris Hilton song and almost seems too sugary for this sexpot of an album. Get Naked is probably the best song on the album. The male voice that loops throughout the song can be irritating, but for once Britney herself actually makes the song more enjoyable. It's nicely arranged and should definitely be a single, though it's not the most memorable track ever. Freakshow has a very minimalistic sound and is one of the most dull songs on the album. There were tracks that leaked months ago that would have replaced this song very well. Toy Soldier, however, is a fun song. It's definitely one of the more creative tracks and has a unique sound that is mostly missing on this ultra-electronic album. Hot as Ice is a catchy, upbeat song, but I liked the demos of it better. In any case at times it's rendered almost unlistenable by Britney's pitchy, girlish vocals. Perfect Lover isn't necessarily a bad song, but it's another one that I find myself skipping due to it's rather generic production. I'm not quite sure what to think of the subdued Why Should I Be Sad. Suffice it to say I was happy that it was the final track on the album. Overall this is an album with a major weak point that you may find very bothersome: Britney's voice. Even if it's never bothered you before, on Blackout it just might.

I bought Revival after hearing "Don't You Wish It Was True."The album is full of good toe-tapping music, but Fogerty quickly slips into left-wing political cliches with "Long Dark Night" and "I Can't Take It No More." If it weren't for these two songs (that won't last the test of time), I'd give this album 5 stars.

Why, oh why, do they master CDs so they only sound decent on stupid iPod earphones these days?!?It sounds absolutely awful.  Bruce should punch whoever allowed the album to be released like this and demand a re-master for the CD version.  What a crying shame.

I've bought every Bruce Springsteen album since Darkness the first day it was released so I'm not a newcomer to Bruce. This is a great collection of songs. Bruce says so much here musically and lyrically, but I have to agree with so many other people that the production is terrible. In listening to this cd a few times in my car I actually considered whether I needed better speakers; until I put in another cd which sounded perfectly fine. I listened to the album online last week through my cheap PC speakers. I loved it and was looking forward to listening to it in high fidelity. Apparently this will never happen unless a remastered version of this comes out many years from now. I find that this cd can not be turned way up without horrible distortion and it is actually tiring to listen to this for long periods of time. Great - a Springsteen cd that I can't crank up and listen to repeatedly. Contrast The Wild, The Innocent and The E Street Shuffle (which was released a mere 34 years ago) with Magic and you'll find you're now waist deep in the Big Muddy.

Folks, just one day into the release, and I see a LOT of negative comments about the sound of this album.  I agree completely.  The audio is severely over processed, extraordinarily shrill in the upper mids, making it PAINFUL to listen to at high volumes.  I don't think we can point the finger at Bob Ludwig who's mastered a zillion of these, but someone on the production side needs some assistance with their hearing aid !This album NEEDS TO BE REMIXED !BTW, the music is GREAT !, and when they fix the audio mix it'll be a great record.  Amazing to me that such an important artist with an important album release could be treated so shabbily.  Columbia Records should be ashamed of themselves.

I guess I'm one of those mean people that some other reviewers on this page have referred to.  I didn't like this movie, although I do like the Beatles and enjoyed all of the songs that are featured in it.  I appreciate zany, bizarre humor as much as anyone.  I don't necessarily ask for a comedy to be logical or even coherent, particularly when the filmmakers are shooting for such a quirky type of humor.  However, it should be funny, and the simple fact is that this film didn't make me laugh.  What can I say?

This poor guy -Like his lyrics in LODI "Has run out of songs to play!"This album is a painful experience never reaching the great HIGHS of his outstanding work in the past- one wishes it did not come from him.I would recommend retirement in double quick time and enjoy his passed glories and the Royalties that go with them.

So I like Britney.  But I like Britney more when she's at least TRYING!  I mean really TRYING!  When she's believing in what it is she's creating and putting out there for her fans.  That was part of her charm.  People would put her down for so many things but she would always try and succeed because she loved music and believed in her music.  She would go into the studio and work with her team and make great songs.  Now, I believe her name is listed under one writing credit on this album after years of her working to build on her music.  In this CD she's not there... maybe it's just me... but I can't put my finger on it.For the most part the album is a blur.  Now I know, I know, it's a dance album.  Great.  But I was expecting Britney to put out a CD that would take me "places".  Not just a CD to dance to on the dance floor or listen to while washing clothes or cleaning the house.  I expected some kind of story from this album but the material is like everything else out there.Girl in club.  Girl sees guy.  Girl dances on guy.  Girl takes guy home.  If not the message, the ideal.  Is that all Britney?  I'm not saying air dirty clothes but she has a million things to sing about now than something so - I don't know what's the word.  I mean.  What happened to songs like "Breathe on Me" or "Shadow" or "Toxic" or something that had a little more creativity behind it (FROM HER) besides the heavy studio men showcasing their engineering skills in the studio.  She sung a beautiful song about her breakup with Justin.  She sung a beautiful song about her baby (which I was hoping was going to be on this one).  To me she proved that she actually has something to say and now... I don't know what this is...Dance CD or not, we've heard Britney sing before on her albums and I could actually hear her.  Now, I can't hear her.  Voice morphed or not.  It's a strain to get pass the noise to hear what she's saying.  I think that's my major problem with this CD is that I can't hear - HEAR her - if she's saying something important that's she's learned or not.And one thing that bugs me about this CD is the supposed "sexy" lyrics and crooning; the fact that she keeps holding on to this image she ONCE had.  Britney.  The fantasy has been ruined for us.  Please believe that.   For those of us expecting a little more, I suggest to just take the CD as it is.  Listen to it or not.  As far as I'm concern I now see she's still in the eye of the storm in her personal life and the creativity isn't there.  Just take the album as it is.  A wild dance CD where you're just going along to the beat, not the message.  Hopefully after she gets whatever she needs in her life she'll have her eyes wide open and ready to grind out something heavy and inspirational.  I'll spin the CD a few more times, I did my part by paying for it blindly and I'm not regretting it.My opinion on BEST tracks...-Heaven on Earth.  Kinda Madonnish.-Get Naked is cool.  It's got that haunting voice that I like.-Toy Soldier.  I might be mistaken but doesn't this sound like something M.I.A. done.  At least vocally.-Perfect Lover is pretty good.  Timbaland did this right?-Why Should I Be Sad.  The only song CLOSEST to what I expected from this CD.

This is a major bump in the road.  Only 4 songs are up to Springsteen standards [this is the stuff you would expect from Seger or Mellencamp] and the production sound is simply the worst I have ever heard on a major record by a major artist on a major label. Every song is mushy and muffled to the extent that it is just one big pile of noise.  Even if the songs were great it wouldn't matter, just listening to this thing is like fingernails on a chalkbord.  Outside of "Radio Nowhere" "Magic" "Livin'In The Future" and "Long Walk Home" there is not one song on this mess that I would want or have any desire to see played live--unless I needed to use the restroom.  I have been a huge Bruce fan since 1978 and it really pains me to see this happen.  Very, very sad indeed.

After hearing this cd a couple of times I regret that it will end up in the bin of cd's that never get played anymore.   I bought into the massive hype this record carries, I greatly respect everyone involved in the project. However, there is nothing new or original here. I hear a flat, very controlled recording. It does not live up to the hype. Next time they do a recording together, and you know they will, put Tom Waits in charge and then they will be really swinging by the tail. Not looking back and worrying about making a mistake.

I have followed MB20 from day 1 and have seen them in concert every time they are anywhere close enough and so looked forward to this release but was very disappointed.  While it's not "terrible" it lacks Rob's usual emotion in his singing and just seems too laid back. The only reason I gave it three stars was because of the greatest hits  (although this is only a sample of their best). I will try to listen again to see if it grows on me but I don't think this will make it to my ipod!!

Hippies who dance in mud at festivals will love this recording's spacey jams, bloated textures, trippy over-production, etc. For long-time Iron & Wine fans (okay, so it's only been five years), expect something different from earlier releases. The intimacy is gone as Beam builds on what he started with Calexico on In The Reins, but takes it too far. "Resurrection Fern" stands out as a nod to his older style. "Boy with a coin" is a stronger song from his new method. It's a quality album overall, but not what people typically turn to Iron & Wine for.

First of all you have to realize that this "conspiracy theory" comes from my opinion that "There is Nothing Left to Lose" is far and away the best Foo Fighters album to date.  When I say "far and away" I'm talking like their other albums or pretty ok, but there's something magical happening on "There is Nothing Left to Lose."Now to the theory:Shortly after Nirvana appeared on unplugged, Kurt sat down with Dave and shared with him some new material he wanted his imput on.  He wanted some help with the arrangements and harmonies and what have you.  Well it wasn't long after all this that Kurt Cobain committed suicide leaving Dave with nothing but the shells of all these amazing songs which he took upon himself to bring to life.  Now, arranging these songs and playing them and recording them took a little while and this is why they released two albums prior to Nothing Left to Lose.  "There is Nothing Left to Lose" is comprised of all the songs Kurt Cobain had planned to record but unfortunately didn't get the chance to.  Go back and listen to the album again, can't you just hear Kurt singing those songs?  REMINDER THAT ALL OF THIS IS BASED ON ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.So why wait until this album to reveal this?  Because I was hoping I was wrong.  I heard a lot of great things about ESP&G before I listened to it, but was once again left wondering where the amazing songs were.  I have yet to hear another song of theirs that even comes as close to being as great as any of the songs on "Nothing Left to Lose."  It's the only thing that makes sense.  It's like which one of these things doesn't belong:  Foo Fighers - okThe Colour and the Shape -okThere is nothing Left to Lose - un freaking believableOne by One - okIn your honor - okESP&G - okI'm just saying.

As a fan, I feel cheated. Contrary to what I have read, Britney does have talent. Sadly, her new CD is a disappointment because is does not demonstrate the talent she possesses. You can't even hear her singing on it really. I do not consider what is on this CD or her larger one to be singing at all. Anyone can talk words that someone else wrote. It is cookiecutter singing that was hand fed to her and I don't consider that talent at all. It is difficult to set aside the media circus that surrounds Britney and all of her negative publicity, especially when you have to take into consideration her fans and her children. I have been a fan of hers for a long time. I enjoyed her music and I never really got into her personal life; however, I find it very difficult to overlook the fact that she is overlooking her fans and taking them for granted, not to mention her own children. She needs to get some help in the worst way and for once I would like to hear her actually sing again and put forth some effort. She has gotten lazy and is forgetting what is filling her pocket with all that money, her fans. Her music isn't bad to dance to but that does not make it good music. It seems that she has become a sellout and sellout music to me is not worth even listening to.

I hate to say it, but Foo Fighters are no longer on the short list of bands whose new albums I'll buy without hearing anything on them first.  I was disappointed with In Your Honor.  I thought it was bloated and had practically no interest at all in the acoustic cd.  Echoes Silence Patience & Grace is just like In Your Honor boiled down to fit on one cd.  About half of the songs rock.  The other songs are perfectly skippable.  I've only had this cd for about a week, and it is already out of heavy rotation.  I find it a very frustrating listen.  It's like a cd of rock like only Foo Fighters can do mixed with a mellow Tori Amos cd.  Since I end up skipping more than half of the songs on the album, I'm only giving the cd 2 stars.  In my opinion, this cd is a poster child for i-Tunes.  Download the handful of good songs.  Don't bother with the rest.
